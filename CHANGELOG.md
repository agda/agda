Release notes for Agda version 2.6.2
====================================

Installation and infrastructure
-------------------------------

* Added support for GHC 8.8.3
  [IssueÂ [#4476](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/4476)].

Command-line interaction
------------------------

* In the previous release, Agda exited with either status 0 when the program
  type checks successfully, or status 1 when encountering any kind of error.
  Now Agda exits with status 42 for type errors, 71 for errors in the
  commandline arguments, and 154 for impossible errors. Exit status 1
  may be returned under other circumstances; for instance, an incomplete
  pattern matching, or an error generated by the Haskell runtime.
  See PR [#4540](https://github.com/agda/agda/pull/4535).

Pragmas and options
-------------------

* New options `--qualified-instances` (default) and
  `--no-qualified-instances`. When `--no-qualified-instances` is
  enabled, Agda will only consider candidates for instance search that
  are in scope under an unqualified name (see
  [#4522](https://github.com/agda/agda/pull/4522)).

* New option `--call-by-name` turns off call-by-need evaluation at type
  checking time.

* New option `--highlight-occurrences` (off by default) enables the HTML
  backend to include a JavaScript file that highlights all occurrences of
  the mouse-hovered symbol (see
  [#4535](https://github.com/agda/agda/pull/4535)).
