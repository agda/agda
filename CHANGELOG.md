Release notes for Agda version 2.8.0
====================================

Highlights
----------

* Agda is now a self-contained single binary.

* Build all Agda files reachable from paths in the `.agda-lib` file with new flag `--build-library`.

* Experimental support for polarity annotations with new flag `--polarity`.

* Compile to JavaScript with ES6 module syntax with new flag `--js-es6`.

* Errors now have an identifier and follow the GNU standard.

Installation
------------

* Dropped support for GHC 8.6, added support for GHC 9.12.

* Agda supports GHC versions 8.8.4 to 9.12.2.

* The `agda` binary now contains everything to set itself up,
  it need not be shipped with additional files.

  1. The functionality of the `agda-mode` executable has been replicated
     under the new option `--emacs-mode`.
     The `agda-mode` executable is now deprecated.
     References to `agda-mode` in your `.emacs` file should be replaced
     by `agda --emacs-mode`.

  2. Agda now contains all its data files,
     like primitive and builtin modules,
     supplements for the HTML and LaTeX backends,
     the runtimes for the `JS` and `GHC` backends,
     and the emacs mode.

     These will be written to `${Agda_datadir}/${VERSION}`
     on the first invocation of `agda` or an invocation of
     `agda --setup`, `agda --emacs-mode setup`, or `agda --emacs-mode compile`.
     Herein, `${VERSION}` is the Agda version and `${Agda_datadir}`
     the Agda data directory, on Unix-like systems
     defaulting to `${HOME}/.local/share/agda`.

  The Cabal/Stack custom installation `Setup.hs` has been removed
  that previously generated the `.agdai` files for the builtin and primitive modules.
  These will now be generated by Agda whenever they are needed,
  just as for ordinary modules.

  This change is **breaking** for packagers of Agda
  as the packaging routines might need to be updated
  (but should become simpler).

* Added cabal build flag `dump-core` to save the optimised GHC Core code during
  compilation of Agda. This can be useful for people working on improving the
  performance of the Agda implementation.

Pragmas and options
-------------------

* New main mode of operation `--build-library` (issue [#4338](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/4338)).
  Invoking `agda --build-library` will look for an `.agda-lib` file starting in the current directory.
  It will then extract the `include` directories of this library,
  collect all Agda files in these directories and their subdirectories,
  and check all these files.

* New option `--setup` that writes out the Agda data files (see above)
  and can be used to regenerate them.

* New option `--emacs-mode` to administer the Emacs mode
  as previously done by the `agda-mode` executable.

* Option `--local-interfaces` and warning `DuplicateInterfaceFiles` have been removed.

* New option `--js-es6` for generating JavaScript with ES6 module syntax.

* `DISPLAY` pragmas can now define display forms that match on defined names
  beyond constructors ([issue #7533](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/7533)).
  Example:
  ```agda
  {-# DISPLAY Irrelevant Empty = ⊥ #-}
  ```
  `Empty` used to be interpreted as a pattern variable, effectively installing
  the display form `Irrelevant _ = ⊥`.
  Now `Empty` is treated as a matchable name, as one would intuitively expect
  from a display form.
  As a consequence, only `Irrelevant Empty` is displayed as `⊥`, not just any
  `Irrelevant A`.

Warnings
--------

* New deadcode warnings `FixingCohesion`, `FixingPolarity` and `FixingRelevance`
  when wrong user-written attribute was corrected automatically by Agda.

* New deadcode warning `InvalidDisplayForm` instead of hard error
  when a display form is illegal (and thus ignored).

* New warning `UnusedVariablesInDisplayForm` when DISPLAY pragma
  binds variables that are not used.
  Example:
  ```agda
  {-# DISPLAY List (Fin n) = ListFin #-}
  ```
  Since pattern variable `n` is not used on the right hand side `ListFin`,
  Agda throws a warning and recommeds to rewrite it as:
  ```agda
  {-# DISPLAY List (Fin _) = ListFin #-}
  ```

* Unused `CATCHALL` pragmas now trigger `UselessPragma` warnings.

* New deadcode warning `EmptyPolarityPragma` for POLARITY pragma without polarities.
  E.g. triggered by `{-# POLARITY F #-}`.

* New deadcode warning `TooManyPolarities` instead of hard error
  when a POLARITY pragma gives polarities that exceed the known
  arity of the postulate.

* New deadcode warning `UselessTactic` when a `@tactic` attribute has no effect,
  typically when it is attached to a non-hidden or instance argument.

* New warning `WithClauseProjectionFixityMismatch` instead of hard error
  when in a with-clause a projection is used in a different fixity
  (prefix vs. postfix) than in its parent clause.

* New error warning `TooManyArgumentsToSort` instead of hard error.

* Warning `AbsurdPatternRequiresNoRHS` has been renamed to
  `AbsurdPatternRequiresAbsentRHS`.

* Warnings `OpenPublicAbstract` and `OpenPublicPrivate` have been replaced
  by new warnings `OpenImportAbstract` and `OpenImportPrivate`.

* Warning `NoGuardednessFlag` has been removed.
  Instead Agda gives a hint when `--guardedness` would help with termination checking,
  unless options `--sized-types` or `--no-guardedness` are set.


Polarity
--------

* Support for polarity annotations can be enabled by the feature flag
  `--polarity`.

  This flag is infective.

  Uses of variables bound with polarity annotations are checked through modal
  typing rules, and the positivity checker has been expanded to take annotations
  into account. This means that the following is now definable:

  ```agda
  {-# OPTIONS --polarity #-}

  data Mu (F : @++ Set → Set) : Set where
    fix : F (Mu F) → Mu F
  ```

Syntax
------

Additions to the Agda syntax.

* Add new literate agda: forester, see [#7403](https://github.com/agda/agda/pull/7403).
  You will need the postprocessor [`agda-tree`](https://github.com/dannypsnl/agda-tree), see Agda user manual on literate programming for more information.

* It is now always possible to refer to the name of a record type's
  constructor, even if a name was not explicitly specified. This is done
  using the new `(Record name).constructor` syntax; See [issue
  #6964](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/6964) for the motivation.

* The *left-hand-sides* of functions bound in a `let` expression can now
  contain the same types of patterns that are allowed in lambda
  expressions, in dependent function types, and in other `let` bindings.

  This means that

  ```agda
  let
    f : A → B → C
    f p1 p2 = ...
  in ...
  ```

  should be accepted exactly when, and have the same meaning as,

  ```agda
  let
    f : A → B → C
    f = λ p1 p2 → ...
  ```

  See [#7572](https://github.com/agda/agda/pull/7572).

Language
--------

Changes to type checker and other components defining the Agda language.

* **BREAKING**: The primitive "cubical identity type", previously
  exported from `Agda.Builtin.Cubical.Id`, has been removed. Its
  computational behaviour is exactly replicated by the user-definable
  identity type, which is also exported from `Agda.Builtin.Equality`.

  See [agda/cubical#1005](https://github.com/agda/cubical/pull/1005) for
  the PR removing it from the library, and
  [#7652](https://github.com/agda/agda/pull/7652) for the compiler.

* Inlining constructors no longer happens on the right-hand-sides of
  `INLINE` functions. This allows using `INLINE` functions to define
  "smart constructors" for record types which have the same reduction
  behaviour as using the actual constructor would. Small example:

  ```agda
  triple : Nat → Nat → Nat → Nat × Nat × Nat
  {-# INLINE triple #-}
  triple x y z = record { fst = x ; snd = y , z }

  ex = triple 1 2 3
  ```

  Here, constructor inlining happens on the right hand side *of `ex`*
  rather than of `triple`.

Reflection
----------

Changes to the meta-programming facilities.

* New reflection primitive: `checkFromStringTC : String → Type → TC Term`

  Parse and type check the given string against the given type, returning
  the resulting term (when successful).


Library management
------------------

* **BREAKING**: Agda no longer accepts several `.agda-lib` files in the root
  of an Agda project.
  (Previously, it allowed this and took the union of their contents.)


Interaction and emacs mode
--------------------------

* Agda's error messages now follow the [GNU standard](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Errors.html).
  To comply with this policy, line and column are now separated by a dot instead of comma.
  The format of regular errors and error warnings follows this template:

  > _sourcefile_:_line1_._column1_-_line2_._column2_: error: [_ErrorName_]
  > ...
  > _error message_
  > ...
  > when _error context_

  _line2_ or even _column2_ can be missing, in some cases even the entire error location.
  Internal errors might follow a different format.

  Warnings are printed in a similar format:

  > _sourcefile_:_line1_._column1_-_line2_._column2_: warning: -W[no]_WarningName_
  > ...
  > _warning text_
  > ...
  > when _warning context_

* Emacs: new face `agda2-highlight-cosmetic-problem-face`
  for highlighting the new aspect `CosmeticProblem`.

* Emacs: new face `agda2-highlight-instance-problem-face`
  for highlighting the new aspect `InstanceProblem`.

* When generating clauses after case splitting on a datatype defined in a parameterised module,
  Agda now prints constructor names without a module prefix rather than fully qualified (see issue #3209).
  This is only a surface-level fix, since Agda might still fail to find the properly qualified name for
  the constructor in scope, but should at least make more sense in most situations.

* New bindings for unicode 'tacks' (⟘⟙⟛⟝⟞⫫⫪) via \tack (as well as specialised names for each of them)

Backends
--------

* New `backendInteractTop/backendInteractHole` fields for providing backend-specific interaction commands (run with keyboard shortcut `C-c C-i`).
