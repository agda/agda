Release notes for Agda version 2.6.5
====================================

Highlights
----------

Installation
------------

* Agda supports GHC versions 8.6.5 to 9.6.3.

* Verbose output printing via `-v` or `--verbose` is now only active if Agda is built with the `debug` cabal flag.
  Without `debug`, no code is generated for verbose printing, which makes building Agda faster and Agda itself
  faster as well.

* Removed the cabal flag `cpphs` that enabled building Agda with `cpphs` instead of the default C preprocessor.
