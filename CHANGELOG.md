Release notes for Agda version 2.6.1
====================================

General
-------

* Agda now has an official logo: ![The official Agda
  logo](doc/user-manual/agda.svg)
  (https://github.com/agda/agda/blob/master/doc/user-manual/agda.svg). The
  logo was chosen by the Agda community from a list of candidates. The winning design was submitted by Miëtek Bak. The list of candidates and the outcome of the poll can be consulted [here](https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/results.pl?id=E_ce6fe5e2a518ac98).

Installation and infrastructure
-------------------------------

* Added support for GHC 8.8.1
  [Issue [#3725](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/3725)].

* Removed support for GHC 7.10.3.

* Interface files are now written in directory `_build/VERSION/agda/` at
  the project root (the closest enclosing directory where an `.agda-lib`
  file is present). If there is no project root then the interface file
  is written alongside the module it corresponds to.
  The flag `--local-interfaces` forces Agda to revert back to storing
  interface files alongside module files no matter what.

* Agda now uses the default RTS options `-H3.5G -M3.5G -A128M`.  If
  you run Agda on a 32-bit system or a system with less than 8GB of
  RAM, it is recommended to set the RTS options explicitly to a lower
  value by running `agda` with option `+RTS -H0.6G -M1.2G -A64M -RTS`
  (for example) or by setting the GHCRTS enviroment variable. See the
  [GHC User's Guide](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/runtime_control.html#setting-rts-options)
  for more information.

* The `CHANGELOG.md` was split. Changes to previous versions of Agda
  are in the directory `doc/release-notes`.

Pragmas and options
-------------------

* New pragma `WARNING_ON_IMPORT` to let module authors raise a warning
  when a module is imported. This can be use to tell users deprecations.

* New option `--confluence-check` (off by default) enables confluence
  checking of user-defined rewrite rules (this only has an effect when
  `--rewriting` is also enabled).

* New option `--no-projection-like` to turn off the analysis whether a
  type signature likens that of a projection.
  Projection-likeness is an optimization that reduces the size of
  terms by dropping parameter-like reconstructible function arguments.
  Thus, it is advisable to leave this optimization on, the flag is
  meant for debugging Agda.

* Option `--no-forcing` is now a pragma option, i.e., the forcing analysis
  can be switched off on a per-file basis via

  ```agda
  {-# OPTIONS --no-forcing #-}
  ```

  at the beginning of the file
  [Issue [#3872](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/3872)].

* New pragma option `--no-flat-split` disables pattern matching on `@♭` arguments.

* New pragma option `--allow-incomplete-matches`. It is similar to
  `--allow-unsolved-metas`: modules containing partial function definitions
  can be imported. Its local equivalent is the `NON_COVERING` pragma to
  be placed before the function (or the block of mutually defined functions)
  which the user knows to be partial.

* Option `--interaction-json` now brings more information about goals,
  unsolved metas, warnings, errors.
  It also displays pretty-printed terms.

* New pragma option `--keep-pattern-variables` to prevent case
  splitting from replacing variables with dot patterns.

Language
--------

### Syntax

* Fractional precedence levels are now supported, see
  Issue [#3991](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/3991). Example:

  ```agda
  infix 3.14 _<_
  ```
  Note that this includes a respective change in the reflected Agda syntax.

* Fixities can now be changed during import in a `renaming` directive,
  see
  Issue [#1346](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/1346). Example:

  ```agda
  open M using (_∙_)
  open M renaming (_∙_ to infixl 10 _*_)
  ```
  After this, `_∙_` is in scope with its original fixity, and as `_*_` as left
  associative operator of precedence 10.

* Implicit non-dependent function spaces `{A} → B` and `{{A}} → B` are now supported.

* Idiom brackets

  Idiom brackets can accommodate none or multiple applications separated by a vertical bar `|`
  if there are two additional operations
  ```agda
  empty : ∀ {A} → F A
  _<|>_ : ∀ {A} → F A → F A → F A
  ```
  i.e. an Alternative type class in Haskell.
  As usual, the new idiom brackets desugar before scope checking.

  Idiom brackets with multiple applications
  ```agda
  (| e₁ a₁ .. aₙ | e₂ a₁ .. aₘ | .. | eₖ a₁ .. aₗ |)
  ```
  expand to (assuming right associative `_<|>_`)
  ```agda
  (pure e₁ <*> a₁ <*> .. <*> aₙ) <|> ((pure e₂ <*> a₁ <*> .. <*> aₘ) <|> (pure eₖ <*> a₁ <*> .. <*> aₗ))
  ```
  Idiom brackets with no application `(|)` or `⦇⦈` are equivalent to `empty`.


* Irrefutable With

  Users can now match on irrefutable patterns on the LHS using a
  pattern-matching `with`. An expression of the form:

  ```agda
  f xs with p1 <- e1 | ... | pn <- en
       with q1 <- f1 | ... | qm <- fm = rhs
  ```

  is translated to nested `with` clauses, essentially equivalent to:

  ```agda
  f xs with e1 | ... | en
  ... | p1 | ... | pn
       with f1 | ... | fm
  ... | q1 | ... | qm = rhs
  ```

* Record patterns in telescopes

  Users can now use record patterns in telescope and lambda abstractions.
  The type of the second projection from a dependent pair is the prototypical
  example It can be defined as follows:

  ```agda
  snd : ((a , _) : Σ A B) → B a
  ```

  And this second projection can be implemented with a lamba-abstraction using
  one of these irrefutable patterns:

  ```agda
  snd = λ (a , b) → b
  ```

  Using an as-pattern, users can get a name for the value as well as for its
  subparts. We can for instance prove that any pair is equal to the pairing
  of its first and second projections:

  ```agda
  eta : (p@(a , b) : Σ A B) → p ≡ (a , b)
  eta p = refl
  ```

* Absurd match in a do block
  The last expression in a do block can now also be an absurd match `() <- f`.

* Named `where` modules are now in scope in the rhs of the clause (see
  Issue [#4050](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/4050)).  Example:

  ```agda
  record Wrap : Set₂ where
    field wrapped : Set₁

  test : Wrap
  test = record { M }
    module M where
      wrapped : Set₁
      wrapped = Set
  ```

* `{{-` is now lexed as `{ {-` rather than `{{ -`,
  see Issue [#3962](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/3962).

* Syntax for large numbers: you can now separate groups of 3 digits using `_`.
  e.g. write `1_000_000` instead of `1000000`.

* `quoteGoal` and `quoteContext` are no longer keywords.

* Record constructors can no longer be qualified by the record module.
  (See Issue [#4189](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/4189).)

  ```agda
  record Foo : Set where
    constructor foo

  works = foo
  fails = Foo.foo
  ```

* `codata` definitions have been removed from the concrete syntax
  Previously they got accepted syntactically, but resulted in errors.

* Imports can now be anonymous.
  (See Issue_[#3727](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/3727).)
  For example, the following will **not** bring `Agda.Builtin.Unit` into scope:
  ```agda
  open import Agda.Builtin.Unit as _
  blah :: ⊤
  blah = tt
  ```

### Type checking

* Type inference for record expressions no longer considers record types from
  modules that have not been imported (Issue [#4267](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/4267)).

  For instance,
  ```agda
  -- A.agda
  module A where
    record R : Set₁ where
      field f : Set
  ```
  ```agda
  -- B.agda
  module B where
    import A
  ```
  ```agda
  -- C.agda
  module C where
    import B
    fails : Set → _
    fails X = record {f = X}  -- import A required to infer record type R
  ```

* The fix of issue [#3903](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/3903) changes
  the algorithm computing the order of case splits, which in some cases may
  lead to unsolved metavariables in previously working code. See issue
  [#4353](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/4353).

### Modalities

* New Flat Modality

  New modality `@♭/@flat` (previously only available in the branch "flat").
  An idempotent comonadic modality modeled after spatial/crisp type theory.
  See "Flat Modality" in the documentation for more.

### Universe levels

* New (experimental) option `--cumulativity`

  When the ``--cumulativity`` flag is enabled, Agda uses the subtyping
  rule ``Set i =< Set j`` whenever ``i =< j``. For example, in
  addition to its usual type ``Set``, ``Nat`` also has the type
  ``Set₁`` and even ``Set i`` for any ``i : Level``. More information
  about this new option can be found in the [user
  manual](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/cumulativity.html).

### Termination checking

* The "with inlining" feature of the termination checker has been
  removed. As a consequence, some functions defined using `with` are
  no longer accepted as terminating. See
  Issue [#59](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/59) for why this
  feature was originally introduced and
  [#3604](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/3604) for why it had to
  be removed.

### Irrelevance and Prop

* Agda will no longer reduce irrelevant definitions and definitions
  with a type in `Prop`. This does not have an effect on the
  semantics, but should lead to improved performance (see Issues
  [#4115](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/4115),
  [#4118](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/4118),
  [#4120](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/4120),
  [#4122](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/4122)).

* Terms of a type in `Prop` are now printed as `_`. To show the actual
  term, you can use the `--show-irrelevant` flag (see
  Issue [#3337](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/3337).

### Rewrite rules

* Rewrite rules (option `--rewriting`) with data or record types as
  the head symbol are no longer allowed (see
  Issue [#3846](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/3846)).

### Tactics & Reflection

* Implicit arguments solved by user-defined tactics

  You can declare tactics to be used to solve a particular implicit argument
  using the following syntax:

  ```agda
  example : {@(tactic f) x : A} → B
  ```

  where `f : Term → TC ⊤`. At calls to `example`, `f` is called on the
  metavariable inserted for `x`. `f` can be an arbitrary term and may depend on
  previous arguments to the function. For instance,

  ```agda
  example₂ : (depth : Nat) {@(tactic search depth) x : A} → B
  ```

  Record fields can also be annotated with a tactic, allowing them to be
  omitted in constructor applications, record constructions and co-pattern
  matches:

  ```agda
  record Example : Set where
    constructor mkExample
    field x : A
          @(tactic solveP x) {y} : P x
  ```

  where `solveP : (x : A) → Term → TC ⊤` is a tactic that tries to
  prove `P x`
  [Issue [#4124](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/4124)].

* The legacy reflection framework using `quoteGoal` and `quoteContext` has been
  removed.

### Builtins

* New primitives

  ```agda
  primWord64ToNatInjective    : ∀ a b → primWord64ToNat a ≡ primWord64ToNat b → a ≡ b

  primFloatToWord64           : Float → Word64
  primFloatToWord64Injective  : ∀ a b → primFloatToWord64 a ≡ primFloatToWord64 b → a ≡ b

  primMetaToNat               : Meta → Nat
  primMetaToNatInjective      : ∀ a b → primMetaToNat a ≡ primMetaToNat b → a ≡ b

  primQNameToWord64s          : Name → Word64 × Word64
  primQNameToWord64sInjective : ∀ a b → primQNameToWord64s a ≡ primQNameToWord64s b → a ≡ b
  ```

  These can be used to define safe decidable propositional equality, see Issue [agda-stdlib#698](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/issues/698).

* New Primitive for showing Natural numbers:

  ```agda
  primShowNat : Nat → String
  ```

  placed in Agda.Builtin.String.

* The builtin `IO` has been declared strictly positive in both its
  level and type argument.

### Warnings

* New warning for a variable shadowing another in a telescope. If the two
  variables are introduced in different telescopes then the warning is not
  raised.

  ```agda
  f : {a : Level} {A : Set a} (a : A) → A   -- warning raised: repeated a
  g : {a : Level} {A : Set a} → (a : A) → A -- warning not raised: two distinct telescopes
  ```

  Note that this warning is turned off by default (you can use
  `-WShadowingInTelescope` or `--warning ShadowingInTelescope` to turn
  it on, `-Wall` would also naturally work).


Emacs mode
----------

* Agda input method: new key bindings `\ G h` and `\ G H` for `η` and
  `H` (capital η)
  [Issue [#3856](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/3856)].

* Syntax highlighting: in literate modes, the pure texts
  (other than Agda code and the code-text separators) are no longer highlighted
  (it was highlighted as comments before).
  This somehow provides more information about how Agda lexes literate files.

* Agda now also displays the values of let-bound variables in the
  context instead of just their types
  [Issue [#4199](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/4199)].

* Agda will now try to preserve the ellipsis (`...`) during case
  splitting when possible. To manually expand the ellipsis, you may
  ask Agda to case split on the special identifier `.`.

* Agda will now also show variables named `_` in the context if they
  are instance arguments (see
  [#4307](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/4307)). Instance
  arguments are now also marked as `(instance)` in the context. Example:

  ```agda
  f : {{_ : A}} → A
  f = ?
  ```

  Agda will now display the goal as follows:

  ```
  Goal: A
  ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
  _ : A   (instance)
  ```


GHC Backend
-----------

* Types which have a COMPILE GHC pragma are no longer erased
  [Issue [#3732](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/3732)].

  ```agda
  data I : Set where
    bar : I

  {-# FOREIGN GHC data I = Bar     #-}
  {-# COMPILE GHC I = data I (Bar) #-}

  data S : Set where
    foo :  I → S

  {-# FOREIGN GHC data S = Foo I #-}
  {-# COMPILE GHC S = data S (Foo) #-}
  ```
  Previously [Issue [#2921](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/2921)],
  the last binding was incorrect, since the argument of
  singleton type `I` was erased from the constructor `foo` during
  compilation.  The required shape of `S` was previously
  ```
  {-# FOREIGN GHC data S = Foo #-}
  ```
  i.e., constructor `Foo` had to have no arguments.

  For the sake of transparency, Haskell constructors bound to
  Agda constructors now take the same arguments.
  This is especially important if Haskell bindings are to be
  produced automatically by third party tool.

LaTeX backend
-------------

* Now the code environment complains if it is given unrecognised options.

  It is also possible to write, say, `hide=true` instead of `hide`,
  and `hide=false` means that the `hide` option should not be used.
  Furthermore the same option can be given multiple times, in which
  case later choices take precedence over earlier ones.

* The code environment has a new option, `number`.

  When the option `number` is used an equation number is generated for
  the code listing. The number is set to the right, centered
  vertically. By default the number is set in parentheses, but this
  can be changed by redefining `\AgdaFormatCodeNumber`.

  The option can optionally be given an argument: when `number=l` is
  used a label `l`, referring to the code listing, is generated. It is
  possible to use this option several times with different labels.

  The option has no effect if used together with `hide`, `inline` or
  `inline*`.

API
----
* Removed module `Agda.Utils.HashMap`. It only re-exported `Data.HashMap.Strict`
  from the package `unordered-containers`. Use `Data.HashMap.Strict` instead.

* Removed module `Agda.Utils.Char`. It used to provide functions converting a
  `Char` in base 8, 10, and 16 to the corresponding `Int`. Use `digitToInt` in
  `Data.Char` instead. The rest of module was about Unicode test which was not
  used.

* `Agda.Utils.List` no longer provides `headMaybe`.
  Use `listToMaybe` in `Data.Maybe` instead.

* `Agda.Utils.Either` no longer provides `mapEither`. Use `bimap` in
  `Data.Bifunctor` instead.

* `Agda.Utils.Map` no longer provides `unionWithM`, `insertWithKeyM`,
  `allWithKey`, `unzip`, and `unzip3`.
