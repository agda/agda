Release notes for Agda version 2.9.0
====================================

Installation
------------

* Dropped support for GHC 8.8, 8.10, and 9.0.

* Agda supports GHC versions 9.2.8 to 9.12.2.

Pragmas and options
-------------------

Warnings
--------

* `UselessPragma` warning instead of hard error `NeedOptionRewriting` when a
  `REWRITE` or `BUILTIN REWRITE` pragma is encountered but `--rewriting` is off.

* New warning `DivergentModalityInClause` when modality of a clause diverges
  from that of the function.  Example:
  ```agda
  A : Set₁
  @0 A = Set
  ```

* New warning `InvalidTacticAttribute` for misplaced `@(tactic ...)` attributes.
  This was silently accepted up to Agda 2.8.0 but raises now the new warning:
  ```agda
  postulate
    @(tactic not-in-scope) _ : Set
  ```

Syntax
------

Additions to the Agda syntax.

* Modality annotations in aliases and let-bindings are now supported
  (PR [#7990]()).
  Example:
  ```agda
    split : {A B C : Set} (@0 p : A × B) (k : @0 A → @0 B → C) → C
    split p k = let @0 (x , y) = q in k x y
      where
      @0 q = p
  ```

Language
--------

Changes to type checker and other components defining the Agda language.

Reflection
----------

Changes to the meta-programming facilities.

Library management
------------------


Interaction and emacs mode
--------------------------

Backends
--------

* New option `--ghc-trace` for GHC Backend to instrument code
  such that the Agda name of the function is printed to `stderr`
  whenever a function is entered.
