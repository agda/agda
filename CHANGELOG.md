Release notes for Agda version 2.6.5
====================================

Highlights
----------

Installation
------------

* Agda supports GHC versions 8.6.5 to 9.8.1.

Pragmas and options
-------------------

Syntax
------

Additions to the Agda syntax.

Language
--------

Changes to type checker and other components defining the Agda language.

* Left-hand side let: `using x ← e`

  This new construct can be using in left-hand sides together with `with` and
  `rewrite` to give names to subexpressions. It is the left-hand side
  counterpart of a `let`-binding and supports the same limited form of pattern
  matching on eta-expandable record values.

  It can be quite useful when you have a function doing a series of nested
  `with`s that share some expressions. Something like

  ```agda
  fun : A → B
  fun x using z ← e with foo z
  ... | p with bar z
  ...   | q = r
  ```

  Here the expression `e` doesn't have to be repeated in the two `with`-expressions.

  As in a `with`, multiple bindings can be separated by a `|`, and variables to
  the left are in scope in bindings to the right.
