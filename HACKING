Working with Git (from 2013-06-15)

Stable branches
--------------------

  For old releases (starting with 2.5.1) there are stable branches
  stable-$VERSION, where e.g. VERSION=2.5.

  Bug fixes should be based on the appropriate stable branch whenever
  possible. See below.

Branches
---------

  Branches should be used generously when fixing bugs and adding
  features. Whenever possible bug fix branches should be based on the
  latest stable branch rather than the master branch.  For instance,
  fixing issue 1234 would work as follows:

    git checkout stable-$VERSION
    git checkout -b issue1234 # create a new branch based on stable-$VERSION
    ... work on issue 1234 ...
    git commit -p             # record some patches

    ... working for a long time on issue 1234 ...
    git rebase stable-$VERSION # get fresh upstream patches, keep own work on top
    git commit -p              # record some more patches

    make install-bin test      # ensure compilation and tests

    # Done!  If you have commit rights:

    ## Merge into stable
    git checkout stable-$VERSION
    git merge issue1234        # merge into stable-$VERSION
    make install-bin test      # ensure compilation and tests
    git push

    ## Merge into master
    git checkout master
    git merge issue1234        # merge into master
    make install-bin test      # ensure compilation and tests
    git push
    git branch -d issue1234    # delete the branch

    # Otherwise, push branch to your GitHub fork of Agda and create a pull
    # request.
    git push -u myfork issue1234
    Go to https://github.com/agda/agda and click the green button next to the
    branch dropdown.

  For new features replace stable-$VERSION with master above.

  The above procedure has the drawback that with each checkout, many
  source files are touched and recompilation is slow.  Here is an
  alternative workflow, if you have commit rights and two local
  repositories, one on master and one on stable-$VERSION (both
  up-to-date).

    stable$  git checkout -b issue1234
    stable$  git commit ...
    stable$  git checkout stable-$VERSION
    stable$  git merge issue1234
    stable$  make install-bin test
    stable$  git push
    stable$  git branch -d issue1234

    # Now fast-forward stable-$VERSION branch without checking it out.
    # Merge it into master (assuming stable-$VERSION is a `subset' of master).

    master$ git fetch origin stable-$VERSION:stable-$VERSION
    master$ git pull
    master$ git merge stable-$VERSION
    master$ make install-bin test
    master$ git push

    # Fast-forward master

    stable$  git fetch origin master:master
    stable$  git pull

Finding the commit that introduced a regression
-----------------------------------------------

  If you want to find the commit that introduced a regression that
  caused Module-that-should-be-accepted to be rejected, then you can
  try the following recipe:

    git clone <agda repository> agda-bug
    cd agda-bug
    git checkout <suitable branch>
    cabal sandbox init
    git bisect start <bad commit> <good commit>
    cp <some path>/Module-that-should-be-accepted.agda .
    git bisect run sh -c \
      "cabal install --force-reinstalls \
                     --disable-library-profiling \
                     --disable-documentation || exit 125; \
       .cabal-sandbox/bin/agda --ignore-interfaces \
         Module-that-should-be-accepted.agda"

  The recipe can be adapted to other situations as well. For instance,
  the commit that introduced a performance regression can perhaps be
  found using the timeout command.

  Here is an example of how git bisect can be used to track down a
  problem introduced in Agda 2.3.2, using a module that should /not/
  be accepted:

    ⋮
    git bisect start 2_3_2 2_3_0
    cp <some path>/Module-that-should-be-rejected.agda .
    git bisect run sh -c \
      "(cabal install --with-alex=alex-2.3.5 \
                      --with-compiler=ghc-7.0.4 \
                      --force-reinstalls \
                      --disable-library-profiling \
                      --disable-documentation && \
        ([ ! -e src/main/Agda-executable.cabal ] || \
         cabal install --with-alex=alex-2.3.5 \
                       --with-compiler=ghc-7.0.4 \
                       --force-reinstalls \
                       --disable-library-profiling \
                       --disable-documentation \
                       src/main/Agda-executable.cabal)) || exit 125; \
       .cabal-sandbox/bin/agda --ignore-interfaces \
                               --no-termination-check \
          Module-that-should-be-rejected.agda && exit 1 || exit 0"

  Here is an example showing how one can track down an internal error:

    ⋮
    cp <some path>/Module.agda .
    git bisect run sh -c \
      "cabal install --force-reinstalls \
                     --disable-library-profiling \
                     --disable-documentation || exit 125; \
       .cabal-sandbox/bin/agda --ignore-interfaces Module.agda | \
         fgrep 'An internal error has occurred. Please report this as a bug.' \
         && exit 1 || exit 0"

  Here is an example showing how one can turn on a flag, but only if
  Agda recognises this flag:

    ⋮
    git bisect run sh -c \
      "cabal install --force-reinstalls \
                     --disable-library-profiling \
                     --disable-documentation || exit 125; \
       .cabal-sandbox/bin/agda \
         \$(if [ -n \"\$(.cabal-sandbox/bin/agda --help | \
                         fgrep -- --no-default-libraries)\" ]; \
            then echo --no-default-libraries; fi) \
         --ignore-interfaces Module.agda"

  And here is an example showing how one can modify the source code
  (in this case by removing constraints on the version of cpphs)
  before compilation starts:

    git bisect run sh <script>

  The script:

    ## Remove cpphs upper bound
    sed -ri -e 's/cpphs >=.*/cpphs/' Agda.cabal
    ## Run the test
    if cabal install --force-reinstalls \
                     --disable-library-profiling \
                     --disable-documentation
    then
        .cabal-sandbox/bin/agda --ignore-interfaces \
          Module-that-should-be-accepted.agda
        status=$?
    else
        status=125
    fi
    ## Clean up and exit
    git reset --hard
    exit $status

Cherry-picking a commit from master into stable
------------------------------------------------

For cherry-picking the commit 123 from master into stable, you can use
the follow instructions:

  * To create two local repositories, one on master and one on
    stable (both up-to-date).

  * Fetch the local master from the local stable

      agda-stable$ git fetch ~/agda-master

  * Cherry-pick the commit 123 into the local stable

      agda-stable$ git cherry-pick 123

  * Merge the local stable into the local master

      agda-master$ git fetch ~/agda-stable
      agda-master$ git merge FETCH_HEAD

  * Push both local repositories

      agda-stable$ git push
      agda-master$ git push

Standard library submodule
--------------------------

* A large part of the test suite involves the standard library.
  Each version of Agda is deemed compatible with a corresponding version of the
  standard library.

* Each commit in the main Agda repository has a reference to a branch and a
  commit in the standard library repository. The tests are run using this
  referenced version of the standard library.

  + The file `/.gitmodules` contains the URL of the standard library
    repository and the name of the branch.

  + The path `/std-lib` is treated by git as a file containing the hash of the
    referenced commit.

* To obtain the referenced version of the standard library, run:
    make std-lib

* To obtain and install the referenced version of the standard library, run:
    make up-to-date-std-lib

* To obtain and install  the newest version of the standard library for the
  referenced branch, run:
    make fast-forward-std-lib

  If the new version of the standard library also passes all tests, you can
  have the repository point to it:
    git add std-lib
    git commit

* The standard library is tracked as a git submodule, which means that the
  `/std-lib` subdirectory will appear as a git repository in a detached-HEAD
  state.

  To avoid this, you may run, inside the submodule directory:
    git checkout <branch name>

  and then, from the root directory:
    git submodule update --remote [--merge|--rebase]

  See: https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules

Testing and documentation
-------------------------

* When you implement a new feature it needs to be documented in
  doc/user-manual/ and doc/release-notes/<next-version>.txt.
  When you fix a bug, drop a note in CHANGELOG.

* In both cases, you need to add regression tests
  under test/Succeed and test/Fail, and maybe also
  test/interaction. When adding test cases under test/Fail, remember
  to record the error messages (.err files) after running make test.

* Run the test-suite, using make test.  Maybe you want to build
  using `make' first as well.

* Additional options for the tests using the Haskell/tasty test runner
  can be given using AGDA_TESTS_OPTIONS. By default,
  the interactive mode (-i) is used and the number of parallel tests
  to run (-j) is set to the number of CPU cores.

  You can select certain tests to run by using the "-p" pattern option.
  For example, to only run the simple MAlonzo compiler tests, you
  can use the following command:
    make AGDA_TESTS_OPTIONS="-i -j8 -p MAlonzo/simple" compiler-test

  You can use the AGDA_ARGS environment variable to pass additional
  arguments to Agda when executing the Succeed/Fail/Compiler tests.

* Tests under test/Fail can fail if an error message has changed.
  You will be asked whether to accept the new error message.
  Alternatively, you can touch the corresponding source file, since,
  when the test case changes, it is assumed that the error message
  changes as well.

* Make sure you do not introduce performance regression.  If you

    make library-test

  you get a small table with benchmarks at the end.
  (Due to garbage collection, these benchmarks are not 100% stable.)
  Compare this with benchmarks before the new feature/bug fix.

* You can obtain a simple profile by using -vprofile:7. This works
  also in the Emacs mode, output goes to the *Agda debug* buffer. Note
  that the -vprofile:7 option is /not/ supposed to be given in an
  OPTIONS pragma, use agda2-program-args.

* To avoid problems with the whitespace test failing we suggest add the
  following lines to .git/hooks/pre-commit

    echo "Starting pre-commit"
    make check-whitespace
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
      exit 1
    fi
    echo "Ending pre-commit"

  You can fix the whitespace issues running

    make install-fix-agda-whitespace
    make fix-whitespace

* To build the user manual locally, you need to install
  the following dependencies:
    - Sphinx and sphinx-rtd-theme

        pip install --user -r doc/user-manual/requirements.txt

      ** The installation of sphinx-rtd-theme also installs Sphinx.

      ** Note that the `--user` option put the Sphinx binaries in
         `$HOME/.local/bin`.

    - LaTeX

  To see the list of available targets, execute `make help`
  in doc/user-manual. E.g., call `make html` to build the
  documentation in html format.

* Running the test-suite using Cabal sandboxes

  If the sandbox uses for example the directory
  `dist/dist-sandbox-12345` you can run the test-suite using the
  following commands:

    export AGDA_BIN=dist/dist-sandbox-12345/build/agda/agda
    export AGDA_TESTS_BIN=dist/dist-sandbox-12345/build/agda-tests/agda-tests
    make test

Some Agda Hacking Lore
----------------------

* Whenever you change the interface file format you should update
  Agda.TypeChecking.Serialise.currentInterfaceVersion.

* Use __IMPOSSIBLE__ instead of calls to error. __IMPOSSIBLE__
  generates errors of the following form:

   An internal error has occurred. Please report this as a bug.
   Location of the error: ...

  Calls to error can make Agda fail with an error message in the *ghci*
  buffer.

* GHC warnings are turned on globally in Agda.cabal. If you want to
  turn on or off an individual warning in a specific file, use an
  OPTIONS_GHC pragma. Don't use -Wall, because the meaning of this
  flag can vary between different versions of GHC.

* The GHC documentation (7.10.1) contains the following information
  about orphan instances:

    "GHC identifies orphan modules, and visits the interface file of
    every orphan module below the module being compiled. This is
    usually wasted work, but there is no avoiding it. You should
    therefore do your best to have as few orphan modules as possible."

    https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/separate-compilation.html#orphan-modules

  In order to avoid /unnecessary/ orphan instances the flag
  -fwarn-orphans is turned on. If you feel that you really want to use
  an orphan instance, place

    {-# OPTIONS_GHC -fno-warn-orphans #-}

  at the top of the module containing the instance.

* To test the UHC backend, you need to install UHC first.
  Follow the process described in the Agda user manual,
  but do ignore the `cabal install -fuhc Agda` command.
  Instead, just call `make` after UHC has been installed,
  and the UHC backend will be enabled automically.

Haskell-mode and the Agda codebase
-----------------------------------

* If you're using a recent haskell-mode (use `M-x package-install
  haskell-mode' to be sure, what's packaged by debian is not enough),
  and you're editing an Haskell file, you can load it up in by tapping
  `C-c C-l', and agreeing to emacs proposals about paths and whatsnot.

  You can toggle from :load to :reload with `C-u C-c C-l', which you
  probably want since otherwise you'll load up the world each time.

  You have semantic jumps with `M-.'.  No more pesky T.A.G.S.!

  You can jump to errors and warnings with `C-x `'.  You can probably do
  many other things, emacs is your oyster.

  One little caveat: GHCi needs some generated files to work.  To make
  sure you have them, you can issue `cabal build' and kill it when it
  starts compiling modules.  There doesn't seem to be a programmatic way
  to instruct cabal to do so.  They're pretty stable so you don't have
  to do that often.

Emacs mode
----------

* Load times (wall-clock time) can be measured using
  agda2-measure-load-time.

* If you fix a bug related to syntax highlighting, please add a test
  case under test/interaction. Example .in file command:

    IOTCM "Foo.agda" NonInteractive Direct (Cmd_load "Foo.agda" [])

  If you want to include interactive highlighting directives, replace
  NonInteractive with Interactive.

* The following elisp code by Nils Anders Danielsson fixes whitespace
  issues upon save.  Add to your .emacs.

  (defvar fix-whitespace-modes
    '(text-mode agda2-mode haskell-mode emacs-lisp-mode LaTeX-mode TeX-mode)
    "*Whitespace issues should be fixed when these modes are used.")

  (add-hook 'before-save-hook
    (lambda nil
      (when (and (member major-mode fix-whitespace-modes)
                 (not buffer-read-only))
        ;; Delete trailing whitespace.
        (delete-trailing-whitespace)
        ;; Insert a final newline character, if necessary.
        (save-excursion
          (save-restriction
            (widen)
            (unless (equal ?\n (char-before (point-max)))
              (goto-char (point-max))
              (insert "\n")))))))

Cabal stuff
-----------

* For running cabal repl use the following command (see
  https://code.google.com/p/agda/issues/detail?id=1196):

  cabal repl --ghc-options=-Wwarn
