When releasing a new version of Agda standard library, the following
procedure can be followed:

* Update README.agda:

  ** Replace 'development version' by 'version X.Y' in the title.

  ** After the list of authors, replace

     -- The development version of the library often requires the latest
     -- development version of Agda.

     by

     -- This version of the library has been tested using Agda A.B.C.

* Update the lib.cabal version to X.Y.

* Ensure that the library type-checks using Agda A.B.C:

  make test

* Finish the release notes in the release-notes.txt file.

* Update the copyright year range in the LICENSE file, if necessary.

* Tag and push version X.Y (do not forget to record the changes above
  first):

  git tag -a vX.Y -m "Agda standard library vX.Y"
  git push --tags

* Update the standard library page on the Agda wiki.

* Removed release-specific information from README.agda and push the
  changes.

* Announce the release of the new version on the Agda mailing list.
