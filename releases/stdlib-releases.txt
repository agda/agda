When releasing a new version of Agda standard library, the following
procedure can be followed:

* Update README.agda:

  ** Replace 'development version' by 'version X.Y' in the title.

  ** After the list of authors, replace

     -- The development version of the library often requires the latest
     -- development version of Agda.

     by

     -- This version of the library has been tested using Agda A.B.C.

* Update the lib.cabal version to X.Y.

* Ensure that the library type-checks using Agda A.B.C:

  make test

* If necessary, copy the contents of releases/future-version.txt to
  releases/releases-notes.txt. Remove the contents from
  releases/future-version.txt

* Finish the release notes (e.g. remove the TODOs) in the
  releases/release-notes.txt file.

* Update the copyright year range in the LICENSE file, if necessary.

* Tag version X.Y (do not forget to record the changes above first):

  git tag -a vX.Y -m "Agda standard library vX.Y"

* Removed release-specific information from README.agda (do not forget
  to record the changes).

* Push all the changes and the new tag (requires Git >= 1.8.3):

  git push --follow-tags

* Update the Agda wiki:

  ** News section on the main page.

  ** The standard library page.

* Announce the release of the new version on the Agda mailing list.
