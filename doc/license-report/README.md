Agda dependencies license report
================================

Using `cabal-plan`, you can generate a listing of the licenses of the Agda dependencies in this directory.
See [Makefile](Makefile) for prerequisites (`cabal-plan`, `pandoc`).

Instructions:

- Run `cabal v2-build` in the root folder (to generate `dist-newstyle/`).
- Run `make` here.
- Result is in `index.html`.
