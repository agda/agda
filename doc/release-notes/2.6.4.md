Release notes for Agda version 2.6.4
====================================

Reflection
----------

* `FOREIGN` and `COMPILE` pragmas can now be generated using two new reflection primitives:

  ```agda
  pragmaForeign : String → String → TC ⊤
  pragmaCompile : String → Name → String → TC ⊤
  ```

Erasure
-------

* [**Breaking**] The new flag `--erasure` turns on support for erasure
  ([#6349](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/6349)).

  This flag is infective.

  Unless this flag is active the following things are prohibited:
  * Use of the annotations `@0` and `@erased`.
  * Use of names defined in Cubical Agda in Erased Cubical Agda.
  * Use of the flag `--erase-record-parameters`.

  When `--erasure` is used the parameter arguments of constructors and
  projections are marked as erased
  ([#4786](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/4786)), with one
  exception: for indexed data types this only happens if the
  `--with-K` flag is active
  ([#6297](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/6297)).

  For instance, the type of the constructor `c` below is `{@0 A :
  Set} → D A`, and the type of the projection `R.f` is `{@0 A : Set}
  → R A → A`:
  ```agda
  {-# OPTIONS --erasure #-}

  data D (A : Set) : Set where
    c : D A

  record R (A : Set) : Set where
    field
      f : A
  ```

* [**Breaking**] Unless the new flag `--erased-matches` is used
  matching is not allowed in erased positions for single-constructor
  data types or record types without η-equality
  ([#6349](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/6349)).

  This flag is infective and implied by `--with-K`.

Pragmas and options
-------------------

* New command-line option `--trace-imports` to switch on notification messages
  on the end of compilation of an imported module
  or on access to an interface file during the type-checking.

  See [--trace-imports](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.4/tools/command-line-options.html#cmdoption-trace-imports)
  in the documentation for more.

* Benign warnings are now printed together with their warning name, to give a hint how they can be disabled
  (see [#6229](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/6229)).

Emacs mode
----------

* Helper function (`C-c C-h`) does not abstract over module parameters anymore
  (see [#2271](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/2271)).
