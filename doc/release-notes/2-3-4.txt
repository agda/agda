-- Release notes for Agda 2 version 2.3.4
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important changes since 2.3.2:

Installation
============

Pragmas and Options
===================

* Pragma NO_TERMINATION_CHECK placed within a mutual block is now
  applied to the whole mutual block (rather than being discarded
  silently).  Adding to the uses 1.-4. outlined in the release notes
  for 2.3.2 we allow:

  3a. Skipping an old-style mutual block: Somewhere within 'mutual'
      block before a type signature or first function clause.

       mutual
         {-# NO_TERMINATION_CHECK #-}
         c : A
         c = d

         d : A
         d = c

Language
========

* Function clauses may now have different arity, e.g.,

    Sum : ℕ → Set
    Sum 0       = ℕ
    Sum (suc n) = ℕ → Sum n

    sum : (n : ℕ) → ℕ → Sum n
    sum 0       acc   = acc
    sum (suc n) acc m = sum n (m + acc)

  or,

    T : Bool → Set
    T true  = Bool
    T false = Bool → Bool

    f : (b : Bool) → T b
    f false true  = false
    f false false = true
    f true = true

Goal and error display
======================

* The error message "Refuse to construct infinite term" has been
  removed, instead one gets unsolved meta variables.  Reason: the
  error was thrown over-eagerly. [Issue 795]

Type checking
=============

* A buggy facility coined "matrix-shaped orders" that supported
  uncurried functions (which take tuples of arguments instead of one
  argument after another) has been removed from the termination
  checker. [Issue 787]

* Definitions which fail the termination checker are not unfolded any
  longer to avoid loops or stack overflows in Agda.  However, the
  termination checker for a mutual block is only invoked after
  type-checking, so there can still be loops if you define a
  non-terminating function.  But termination checking now happens
  befor the other supplementary checks: positivity, polarity,
  injectivity and projection-likeness.
  Note that with the pragma {-# NO_TERMINATION_CHECK #-} you can make
  Agda treat any function as terminating.

Compiler backends
=================

Tools
=====

Emacs mode
----------

* Key bindings for lots of "mathematical" characters (examples: 𝐴𝑨𝒜𝓐𝔄)
  have been added to the Agda input method.

* Key bindings for "blackboard bold" B (𝔹) and 0-9 (𝟘-𝟡) have been added
  to the Agda input method (\bb and \b[0-9]).

LaTeX-backend
-------------

* Two new color scheme options were added to agda.sty:

  \usepackage[bw]{agda}, which highlights in black and white;
  \usepackage[conor]{agda}, which highlights using Conor's colors.

  The default (no options passed) is to use the standard colors.
