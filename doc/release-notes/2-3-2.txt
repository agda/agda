------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Release notes for Agda 2 version 2.3.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important changes since 2.3.0:

Installation
============

* The Agda-executable package has been removed.

  The executable is now provided as part of the Agda package.

* The Emacs mode no longer depends on haskell-mode or GHCi.

* Compilation of Emacs mode Lisp files.

  You can now compile the Emacs mode Lisp files by running "agda-mode
  compile". This command is run by "make install".

  WARNING: If you reinstall the Agda mode without recompiling the
  Emacs Lisp files, then Emacs may continue using the old, compiled
  files.

Pragmas and Options
===================

* The --without-K check now reconstructs constructor parameters.

  New specification of --without-K:

  If the flag is activated, then Agda only accepts certain
  case-splits. If the type of the variable to be split is D pars ixs,
  where D is a data (or record) type, pars stands for the parameters,
  and ixs the indices, then the following requirements must be
  satisfied:

  * The indices ixs must be applications of constructors (or literals)
    to distinct variables. Constructors are usually not applied to
    parameters, but for the purposes of this check constructor
    parameters are treated as other arguments.

  * These distinct variables must not be free in pars.

* Irrelevant arguments are printed as _ by default now.  To turn on
  printing of irrelevant arguments, use option

    --show-irrelevant

* New: Pragma NO_TERMINATION_CHECK to switch off termination checker
  for individual function definitions and mutual blocks.

  The pragma must precede a function definition or a mutual block.
  Examples (see test/succeed/NoTerminationCheck.agda):

  1. Skipping a single definition: before type signature.

       {-# NO_TERMINATION_CHECK #-}
       a : A
       a = a

  2. Skipping a single definition: before first clause.

       b : A
       {-# NO_TERMINATION_CHECK #-}
       b = b

  3. Skipping an old-style mutual block: Before 'mutual' keyword.

       {-# NO_TERMINATION_CHECK #-}
       mutual
         c : A
         c = d

         d : A
         d = c

  4. Skipping a new-style mutual block: Anywhere before a type
     signature or first function clause in the block

       i : A
       j : A

       i = j
       {-# NO_TERMINATION_CHECK #-}
       j = i

  The pragma cannot be used in --safe mode.

Language
========

* Let binding record patterns

    record _×_ (A B : Set) : Set where
      constructor _,_
      field
        fst : A
        snd : B
    open _×_

    let (x , (y , z)) = t
    in  u

  will now be interpreted as

    let x = fst t
        y = fst (snd t)
        z = snd (snd t)
    in  u

  Note that the type of t needs to be inferable.  If you need to provide
  a type signature, you can write the following:

    let a : ...
        a = t
        (x , (y , z)) = a
    in  u

* Pattern synonyms

  A pattern synonym is a declaration that can be used on the left hand
  side (when pattern matching) as well as the right hand side (in
  expressions). For example:

  pattern z    = zero
  pattern ss x = suc (suc x)

  f : ℕ -> ℕ
  f z       = z
  f (suc z) = ss z
  f (ss n)  = n

  Pattern synonyms are implemented by substitution on the abstract
  syntax, so definitions are scope-checked but not type-checked. They
  are particularly useful for universe constructions.

* Qualified mixfix operators

  It is now possible to use a qualified mixfix operator by qualifying the first
  part of the name. For instance

    import Data.Nat as Nat
    import Data.Bool as Bool

    two = Bool.if true then 1 Nat.+ 1 else 0

* Instantiating a module in an open import statement [Issue 481].  Now accepted:

    open import Path.Module args [using/hiding/renaming (...)]

  This only brings the imported identifiers from Path.Module into scope,
  not the module itself!

  You can give a private name M to the instantiated module via

    open import Path.Module args as M [using/hiding/renaming (...)]

  Try to avoid 'as' as part of the arguments.  'as' is not a keyword;
  the following can be legal, although slightly obfuscated Agda code:

    open import as as as as as as

* Implicit module parameters can be given by name.

  This feature was (accidentally?) introduced in Agda 2.3.0.

* Multiple type signatures sharing a same type can now be written as a single
  type signature.

    one two : ℕ
    one = suc zero
    two = suc one

Type checking
=============

* Improved coverage checker.  The coverage checker splits on
  arguments that have constructor or literal pattern, committing
  to the left-most split that makes progress.
  Consider the lookup function for vectors:

    data Fin : Nat → Set where
      zero : {n : Nat} → Fin (suc n)
      suc  : {n : Nat} → Fin n → Fin (suc n)

    data Vec (A : Set) : Nat → Set where
      []  : Vec A zero
      _∷_ : {n : Nat} → A → Vec A n → Vec A (suc n)

    _!!_ : {A : Set}{n : Nat} → Vec A n → Fin n → A
    (x ∷ xs) !! zero  = x
    (x ∷ xs) !! suc i = xs !! i

  In Agda up to 2.3.0, this definition is rejected unless we add
  an absurd clause

    [] !! ()

  This is because the coverage checker committed on splitting
  on the vector argument, even though this inevitably lead to
  failed coverage, because a case for the empty vector [] is missing.

  The improvement to the coverage checker consists on committing
  only on splits that have a chance of covering, since all possible
  constructor patterns are present.  Thus, Agda will now split
  first on the Fin argument, since cases for both zero and suc are
  present.  Then, it can split on the Vec argument, since the
  empty vector is already ruled out by instantiating n to a suc _.

* Instance arguments resolution will now consider candidates which
  still need expect arguments. For example:

    record Eq (A : Set) : Set where
      field eq : A → A → Bool

    open Eq {{...}}

    eqFin : {n : ℕ} → Eq (Fin n)
    eqFin = record { eq = primEqFin }

    testFin : Bool
    testFin = eq fin1 fin2

  The type-checker will now resolve the instance argument of the eq
  function to eqFin {_}. This is only done for implicit arguments, not
  instance arguments, so that the instance search stays non-recursive.

* Constraint solving: Upgraded Miller patterns to record patterns. [Issue 456]

  Agda now solves meta-variables that are applied to record patterns.
  A typical (but here, artificial) case is:

    record Sigma (A : Set)(B : A -> Set) : Set where
      constructor _,_
      field
        fst : A
        snd : B fst

    test : (A : Set)(B : A -> Set) ->
      let X : Sigma A B -> Sigma A B
          X = _
      in  (x : A)(y : B x) -> X (x , y) ≡ (x , y)
    test A B x y = refl

  This yields a constraint of the form

    _X A B (x , y) := t[x,y]

  (with t[x,y] = (x, y)) which is not a Miller pattern.
  However, Agda now solves this as

    _X A B z := t[fst z,snd z].

* Changed: solving recursive constraints.  [Issue 585]

  Until 2.3.0, Agda sometimes inferred values that did not pass the
  termination checker later, or would even make Agda loop.  To prevent this,
  the occurs check now also looks into the definitions of the current mutual
  block, to avoid constructing recursive solutions.  As a consequence, also
  terminating recursive solutions are no longer found automatically.

  This effects a programming pattern where the recursively computed
  type of a recursive function is left to Agda to solve.

    mutual

      T : D -> Set
      T pattern1 = _
      T pattern2 = _

      f : (d : D) -> T d
      f pattern1 = rhs1
      f pattern2 = rhs2

  This might no longer work from now on.
  See examples test/fail/Issue585*.agda

* Less eager introduction of implicit parameters.  [Issue 679]

  Until Agda 2.3.0, trailing hidden parameters were introduced eagerly
  on the left hand side of a definition.  For instance, one could not
  write

    test : {A : Set} -> Set
    test = \ {A} -> A

  because internally, the hidden argument {A : Set} was added to the
  left-hand side, yielding

    test {_} = \ {A} -> A

  which raised a type error.  Now, Agda only introduces the trailing
  implicit parameters it has to, in order to maintain uniform function
  arity.  For instance, in

    test : Bool -> {A B C : Set} -> Set
    test true {A}      = A
    test false {B = B} = B

  Agda will introduce parameters A and B in all clauses, but not C,
  resulting in

    test : Bool -> {A B C : Set} -> Set
    test true  {A} {_}     = A
    test false {_} {B = B} = B

  Note that for checking where-clauses, still all hidden trailing
  parameters are in scope.  For instance:

    id : {i : Level}{A : Set i} -> A -> A
    id = myId
      where myId : forall {A} -> A -> A
            myId x = x

  To be able to fill in the metavariable _1 in

    myId : {A : Set _1} -> A -> A

  the hidden parameter {i : Level} needs to be in scope.

  As a result of this more lazy introduction of implicit parameters,
  the following code now passes.

    data Unit : Set where
      unit : Unit

    T : Unit → Set
    T unit = {u : Unit} → Unit

    test : (u : Unit) → T u
    test unit with unit
    ... | _ = λ {v} → v

  Before, Agda would eagerly introduce the hidden parameter {v} as
  unnamed left-hand side parameter, leaving no way to refer to it.

  The related issue 655 has also been adressed.  It is now possible
  to make `synonymn' definitions

    name = expression

  even when the type of expression begins with a hidden quantifier.
  Simple example:

    id2 = id

  That resulted in unsolved metas until 2.3.0.

* Agda detects unused arguments and ignores them during equality
  checking. [Issue 691, solves also issue 44.]

  Agda's polarity checker now assigns 'Nonvariant' to arguments
  that are not actually used (except for absurd matches).  If
  f's first argument is Nonvariant, then f x is definitionally equal
  to f y regardless of x and y.  It is similar to irrelevance, but
  does not require user annotation.

  For instance, unused module parameters do no longer get in the way:

    module M (x : Bool) where

      not : Bool → Bool
      not true  = false
      not false = true

    open M true
    open M false renaming (not to not′)

    test : (y : Bool) → not y ≡ not′ y
    test y = refl

  Matching against record or absurd patterns does not count as `use',
  so we get some form of proof irrelevance:

    data ⊥ : Set where
    record ⊤ : Set where
      constructor trivial

    data Bool : Set where
      true false : Bool

    True : Bool → Set
    True true  = ⊤
    True false = ⊥

    fun : (b : Bool) → True b → Bool
    fun true  trivial = true
    fun false ()

    test : (b : Bool) → (x y : True b) → fun b x ≡ fun b y
    test b x y = refl

  More examples in test/succeed/NonvariantPolarity.agda.

  Phantom arguments:  Parameters of record and data types are considered
  `used' even if they are not actually used.  Consider:

    False : Nat → Set
    False zero    = ⊥
    False (suc n) = False n

    module Invariant where
      record Bla (n : Nat)(p : False n) : Set where

    module Nonvariant where
      Bla : (n : Nat) → False n → Set
      Bla n p = ⊤

  Even though record `Bla' does not use its parameters n and p, they
  are considered as used, allowing "phantom type" techniques.

  In contrast, the arguments of function `Bla' are recognized as unused.
  The following code type-checks if we open Invariant but leaves unsolved
  metas if we open Nonvariant.

    drop-suc : {n : Nat}{p : False n} → Bla (suc n) p → Bla n p
    drop-suc _ = _

    bla : (n : Nat) → {p : False n} → Bla n p → ⊥
    bla zero {()} b
    bla (suc n) b = bla n (drop-suc b)

  If `Bla' is considered invariant, the hidden argument in the recursive
  call can be inferred to be `p'.  If it is considered non-variant, then
  `Bla n X = Bla n p' does not entail `X = p' and the hidden argument
  remains unsolved.  Since `bla' does not actually use its hidden argument,
  its value is not important and it could be searched for.
  Unfortunately, polarity analysis of `bla' happens only after type
  checking, thus, the information that `bla' is non-variant in `p' is
  not available yet when meta-variables are solved.
  (See test/fail/BrokenInferenceDueToNonvariantPolarity.agda)


Compiler backends
=================

* -Werror is now overridable.

  To enable compilation of Haskell modules containing warnings, the
  -Werror flag for the MAlonzo backend has been made overridable. If,
  for example, --ghc-flag=-Wwarn is passed when compiling, one can get
  away with things like:

    data PartialBool : Set where
      true : PartialBool

    {-# COMPILED_DATA PartialBool Bool True #-}

  The default behaviour remains as it used to be and rejects the above
  program.

Tools
=====

Emacs mode
----------

* Asynchronous Emacs mode.

  One can now use Emacs while a buffer is type-checked. If the buffer
  is edited while the type-checker runs, then syntax highlighting will
  not be updated when type-checking is complete.

* Interactive syntax highlighting.

  The syntax highlighting is updated while a buffer is type-checked:

  • At first the buffer is highlighted in a somewhat crude way
    (without go-to-definition information for overloaded
    constructors).

  • If the highlighting level is "interactive", then the piece of code
    that is currently being type-checked is highlighted as such. (The
    default is "non-interactive".)

  • When a mutual block has been type-checked it is highlighted
    properly (this highlighting includes warnings for potential
    non-termination).

  The highlighting level can be controlled via the new configuration
  variable agda2-highlight-level.

* Multiple case-splits can now be performed in one go.

  Consider the following example:

    _==_ : Bool → Bool → Bool
    b₁ == b₂ = {!!}

  If you split on "b₁ b₂", then you get the following code:

    _==_ : Bool → Bool → Bool
    true == true = {!!}
    true == false = {!!}
    false == true = {!!}
    false == false = {!!}

  The order of the variables matters. Consider the following code:

    lookup : ∀ {a n} {A : Set a} → Vec A n → Fin n → A
    lookup xs i = {!!}

  If you split on "xs i", then you get the following code:

    lookup : ∀ {a n} {A : Set a} → Vec A n → Fin n → A
    lookup [] ()
    lookup (x ∷ xs) zero = {!!}
    lookup (x ∷ xs) (suc i) = {!!}

  However, if you split on "i xs", then you get the following code
  instead:

    lookup : ∀ {a n} {A : Set a} → Vec A n → Fin n → A
    lookup (x ∷ xs) zero = ?
    lookup (x ∷ xs) (suc i) = ?

  This code is rejected by Agda 2.3.0, but accepted by 2.3.2 thanks
  to improved coverage checking (see above).

* The Emacs mode now presents information about which module is
  currently being type-checked.

* New global menu entry: Information about the character at point.

  If this entry is selected, then information about the character at
  point is displayed, including (in many cases) information about how
  to type the character.

* Commenting/uncommenting the rest of the buffer.

  One can now comment or uncomment the rest of the buffer by typing
  C-c C-x M-; or by selecting the menu entry "Comment/uncomment the
  rest of the buffer".

* The Emacs mode now uses the Agda executable instead of GHCi.

  The *ghci* buffer has been renamed to *agda2*.

  A new configuration variable has been introduced:
  agda2-program-name, the name of the Agda executable (by default
  agda).

  The variable agda2-ghci-options has been replaced by
  agda2-program-args: extra arguments given to the Agda executable (by
  default none).

  If you want to limit Agda's memory consumption you can add some
  arguments to agda2-program-args, for instance +RTS -M1.5G -RTS.

* The Emacs mode no longer depends on haskell-mode.

  Users who have customised certain haskell-mode variables (such as
  haskell-ghci-program-args) may want to update their configuration.

* Command which compiles the Emacs mode's files.

  You can compile the Emacs mode's files using "agda-mode compile".
  This can, in some cases, give a noticeable speedup.

  WARNING: If you reinstall the Agda mode without recompiling the
  Emacs Lisp files, then Emacs may continue using the old, compiled
  files.

LaTeX-backend
-------------

An experimental LaTeX-backend which does precise highlighting a la the
HTML-backend and code alignment a la lhs2TeX has been added.

Here is a sample input literate Agda file:

  \documentclass{article}

  \usepackage{agda}

  \begin{document}

  The following module declaration will be hidden in the output.

  \AgdaHide{
  \begin{code}
  module M where
  \end{code}
  }

  Two or more spaces can be used to make the backend align stuff.

  \begin{code}
  data ℕ : Set where
    zero  : ℕ
    suc   : ℕ → ℕ

  _+_ : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
  zero   + n = n
  suc m  + n = suc (m + n)
  \end{code}

  \end{document}

To produce an output PDF issue the following commands:

  agda --latex -i . <file>.lagda
  pdflatex latex/<file>.tex

Only the top-most module is processed, like with lhs2tex and unlike with
the HTML-backend. If you want to process imported modules you have to
call agda --latex manually on each of those modules.

There are still issues related to formatting, see the bug tracker for
more information:

  https://code.google.com/p/agda/issues/detail?id=697

The default agda.sty might therefore change in backwards-incompatible
ways, as work proceeds in trying to resolve those problems.


Implemented features:

  * Two or more spaces can be used to force alignment of things, like
    with lhs2tex. See example above.

  * The highlighting information produced by the typechecker is used to
    generate the output. For example, the data declaration in the example
    above, produces:

      \AgdaKeyword{data} \AgdaDatatype{ℕ} \AgdaSymbol{:}
          \AgdaPrimitiveType{Set} \AgdaKeyword{where}

    These latex commands are defined in agda.sty (which is imported by
    \usepackage{agda}) and cause the highlighting.

  * The latex-backend checks if agda.sty is found by the latex
    environment, if it isn't a default agda.sty is copied from Agda's
    data-dir into the working directory (and thus made available to the
    latex environment).

    If the default agda.sty isn't satisfactory (colours, fonts, spacing,
    etc) then the user can modify it and make put it somewhere where the
    latex environment can find it. Hopefully most aspects should be
    modifiable via agda.sty rather than having to tweak the
    implementation.

  * --latex-dir can be used to change the default output directory.
