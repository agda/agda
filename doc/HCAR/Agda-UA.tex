Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language (developed
using Haskell). A central feature of Agda is inductive families,
i.e., GADTs which can be indexed by \emph{values} and not just types.
The language also supports coinductive types, parameterized modules,
and mixfix operators, and comes with an \emph{interactive}
interface---the type checker can assist you in the development of your
code.

A lot of work remains in order for Agda to become a full-fledged
programming language (good libraries, mature compilers, documentation,
etc.), but already in its current state it can provide lots of value as a
platform for research and experiments in dependently typed programming.

Some highlights from the past six months:
\begin{compactitem}
\item Agda~2.5.3 was released in September 2017.
\item The Agda documentation at
\url{http://agda.readthedocs.org/en/stable/} is being continuously improved.
\item Experimental support for homotopy type theory has been added to the
developement branch by Andrea Vezzosi.
\end{compactitem}
