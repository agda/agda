**********
Emacs Mode
**********

Agda programs are commonly edited using `Emacs
<http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`_ which is explained in this section.
If you use Atom, please refer to the `agda-mode on Atom
<https://atom.io/packages/agda-mode>`_.

:ref:`quick-guide-introduction`
===============================

Configuration
=============

If you want to you can customise the Emacs mode. Just start Emacs and
type the following:

.. code-block:: emacs

  M-x load-library RET agda2-mode RET
  M-x customize-group RET agda2 RET

If you want some specific settings for the Emacs mode you can add them
to ``agda2-mode-hook``. For instance, if you do not want to use the
Agda input method (for writing various symbols like ∀≥ℕ→π⟦⟧) you can
add the following to your *.emacs*:

.. code-block:: emacs

  (add-hook 'agda2-mode-hook
            '(lambda ()
              ; If you do not want to use any input method:
              (deactivate-input-method)
              ; (In some versions of Emacs you should use
              ; inactivate-input-method instead of
              ; deactivate-input-method.)

Note that, on some systems, the Emacs mode changes the default font of
the current frame in order to enable many Unicode symbols to be
displayed. This only works if the right fonts are available, though.
If you want to turn off this feature, then you should customise the
``agda2-fontset-name`` variable.

Keybindings
===========

.. _notation-for-key-combinations:

Notation for key combinations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following notation is used when describing key combinations:

:kbd:`C-c`
     means hitting the ``c`` key while pressing the ``Ctrl``
     key.

:kbd:`M-x`
     means hitting the ``x`` key while pressing the ``Meta``
     key, which is called ``Alt`` on many systems. Alternatively one
     can type ``Escape`` followed by ``x`` (in separate key strokes).

:kbd:`RET`
     is the ``Enter``, ``Return`` or ``⏎`` key.

:kbd:`SPC`
     is the space bar.

Commands working with types can be prefixed with ``C-u`` to compute
type without further normalisation and with ``C-u C-u`` to compute
normalised types.

.. _unicode-input:

Unicode input
=============

How can I write Unicode characters using Emacs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Agda Emacs mode comes with an input method for easily writing
Unicode characters. Most Unicode character can be input by typing
their corresponding TeX/LaTeX commands, eg. typing ``\lambda`` will
input ``λ``. Some characters have key bindings which have not been
taken from TeX/LaTeX (typing ``\bN`` results in ``ℕ`` being inserted,
for instance), but all bindings start with ``\``.

To see all characters you can input using the Agda input method type
``M-x describe-input-method RET Agda`` or type ``M-x
agda-input-show-translations RET RET`` (with some exceptions in
certain versions of Emacs).

If you know the Unicode name of a character you can input it using
``M-x ucs-insert RET`` (which supports tab-completion) or ``C-x 8
RET``. Example: Type ``C-x 8 RET not SPACE a SPACE sub TAB RET`` to
insert the character "NOT A SUBSET OF" (``⊄``).

(The Agda input method has one drawback: if you make a mistake while
typing the name of a character, then you need to start all over
again. If you find this terribly annoying, then you can use `Abbrev
mode
<https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Abbreviation>`_
instead. However, note that Abbrev mode cannot be used in the
minibuffer, which is used to give input to many Agda and Emacs
commands.)

The Agda input method can be customised via ``M-x customize-group RET
agda-input``.

OK, but how can I find out what to type to get the ... character?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To find out how to input a specific character, eg from the standard
library, position the cursor over the character and type ``M-x
describe-char`` or ``C-u C-x =``.

For instance, for ``∷`` I get the following:

.. code-block:: none

              character: ∷ (displayed as ∷) (codepoint 8759, #o21067, #x2237)
      preferred charset: unicode (Unicode (ISO10646))
  code point in charset: 0x2237
                 script: symbol
                 syntax: w      which means: word
               category: .:Base, c:Chinese
               to input: type "\::" with Agda input method
            buffer code: #xE2 #x88 #xB7
              file code: #xE2 #x88 #xB7 (encoded by coding system utf-8-unix)
                display: by this font (glyph code)
      x:-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--20-200-75-75-c-100-iso10646-1 (#x2237)

  Character code properties: customize what to show
    name: PROPORTION
    general-category: Sm (Symbol, Math)
    decomposition: (8759) ('∷')

  There are text properties here:
    fontified            t

Here it says that I can type ``\::`` to get a ``∷``. If there is no
"to input" line, then you can add a key binding to the Agda input
method by using ``M-x customize-variable RET
agda-input-user-translations``.

Show me some commonly used characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many common characters have a shorter input sequence than the
corresponding TeX command:

- **Arrows**: ``\r-`` for ``→``. You can replace ``r`` with another
  direction: ``u``, ``d``, ``l``. Eg. ``\d-`` for ``↓``. Replace
  ``-`` with ``=`` or ``==`` to get a double and triple arrows.
- **Greek letters** can be input by ``\G`` followed by the
  first character of the letters Latin name. Eg. ``\Gl`` will input
  ``λ`` while ``\GL`` will input ``Λ``.
- **Negation**: you can get the negated form of many characters by
  appending ``n`` to the name. Eg. while ``\ni`` inputs ``∋``,
  ``\nin`` will input ``∌``.
- **Subscript** and **superscript**: you can input subscript or
  superscript forms by prepending the character with ``\_`` (subscript)
  or ``\^`` (superscript). Note that not all characters have a
  subscript or superscript counterpart in Unicode.
