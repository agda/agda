If you're new to Agda, you should make use of the resources on Agda Wiki
and chapter :ref:`getting-started` instead of chapter :ref:`language-index`.

A description of the Agda language is given in chapter :ref:`language-index`.
Guidance on how the Agda editing and compilation
system can be used can be found in chapter :ref:`tools-index`.
