This is the manual for the Agda programming language, its type checking,
compilation and editing system and related resources/tools.

You can find a lot of useful resources on `Agda Wiki
<http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php?n=Main.HomePage>`_
site, like `tutorials, introductions, publications and books
<http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Documentation>`_.
If you're new to Agda, you should make use of the resources on Agda Wiki
instead of the language reference provided here.

A description of the Agda language is given in chapter :ref:`language-index`.
Guidance on how the Agda editing and compilation
system can be used can be found in chapter :ref:`tools-index`.
