Function declarations
---------------------

The general form for defining a function is
::
 f : (x1 : A1) → … → (xn : An) → B
 f p1 … pn = d
 …
 f q1 … qn = e
where f is a new identifier, A is a type, B is a type under the assumption that the variable x has the type A, p_i and q_i are patterns and d and e are expressions.

The declaration above gives the identifier f type (x1 : A1) → … → (xn : An) → B and f is defined by the defining equations. Patterns are matched from top to bottom, i.e., the first pattern that matches the actual parameters is the one that is used.

Abstraction
-----------
An object in the type (x : A) → B is always equal to
::
 \x → b
where b : B under the assumption that x : A.

Typed abstraction can also be used:
::
 \(x : A) → b
is another notation for the abstraction above if the type of the variable x is A.

Application
-----------
The application of a function f : (x : A) → B to an argument a : A is written f a and the type of this is B[x := a]

Notational conventions
----------------------
The following notational conventions can be used

function types
::
 (x : A)(y : B) → C    is the same as (x : A) → (y : B) → C
 (x y : A) → C         is the same as (x : A)(y : A) → C
 forall (x : A) → C    is the same as (x : A) → C
 forall x → C          is the same as (x : _) → C
 forall x y → C        is the same as forall x → forall y → C
You can also use the Unicode symbol ∀ (type “\all” in the Emacs Agda mode) instead of forall.

functional abstraction
::
 \x y → e  is the same as \x → (\y → e)

functional application
::
 f a b  is the same as (f a) b
