Instance Arguments

Instance arguments are the Agda equivalent of Haskell type class
constraints and can be used for many of the same purposes. In Agda
terms, they are :ref:`implicit arguments <implicit-arguments>` that
get solved by a special :ref:`instance
resolution <instance-resolution>` algorithm, rather than by the
unification algorithm used for normal implicit arguments. In
principle, an instance argument is resolved, if a unique *instance* of
the required type can be built from :ref:`declared
instances <declaring-instances>` and the current context.

Usage
-----

Instance arguments are enclosed in double curly braces ``{{ }}``, e.g. ``{{x : T}}``.
Alternatively they can be enclosed, with proper spacing, e.g. ``⦃ x : T ⦄``, in the
unicode braces ``⦃ ⦄`` (``U+2983`` and ``U+2984``, which can be typed as
``\{{`` and ``\}}`` in the :ref:`Emacs mode <unicode-input>`).

For instance, given a function ``_==_``

..
  ::

  _||_ : Bool → Bool → Bool
  true  || _ = true
  false || y = y

  _&&_ : Bool → Bool → Bool
  false && _ = false
  true  && y = y

  infixl 10 _||_ _&&_

  _++_ : ∀ {u} {A : Set u} → List A → List A → List A
  [] ++ xs = xs
  (x ∷ xs) ++ ys = x ∷ (xs ++ ys)

  module eq-prototype (Eq : Set → Set) where

::

    _==_ : {A : Set} {{eqA : Eq A}} → A → A → Bool

..
  ::
    _==_ = undefined

for some suitable type ``Eq``, you might define

..
  ::
    module elem-one where

::

      elem : {A : Set} {{eqA : Eq A}} → A → List A → Bool
      elem x (y ∷ xs) = x == y || elem x xs
      elem x []       = false

Here the instance argument to ``_==_`` is solved by the corresponding argument
to ``elem``. Just like ordinary implicit arguments, instance arguments can be
given explicitly. The above definition is equivalent to

..
  ::
    module elem-bis where

::

      elem : {A : Set} {{eqA : Eq A}} → A → List A → Bool
      elem {{eqA}} x (y ∷ xs) = _==_ {{eqA}} x y || elem {{eqA}} x xs
      elem         x []       = false

A very useful function that exploits this is the function ``it`` which lets you
apply instance resolution to solve an arbitrary goal::

  it : ∀ {a} {A : Set a} {{_ : A}} → A
  it {{x}} = x

Note that instance arguments in types are always named, but the name can be ``_``:

.. code-block:: agda

  _==_ : {A : Set} → {{Eq A}} → A → A → Bool    -- INVALID

..
  ::
  module example-underscore (Eq : Set → Set) where

::

     _==_ : {A : Set} {{_ : Eq A}} → A → A → Bool  -- VALID

..
  ::
     _==_ = undefined

Defining type classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The type of an instance argument should have the form ``{Γ} → C vs``,
where ``C`` is a postulated name, a bound variable, or the name of a
data or record type, and ``{Γ}`` denotes an arbitrary number of
(ordinary) implicit arguments (see :ref:`dependent-instances` below
for an example where ``Γ`` is non-empty). Instance arguments that do
not have this form are currently accepted, but instance resolution may
or may not work as described below for such arguments.

Other than that there are no requirements on the type of an instance
argument. In particular, there is no special declaration to say that a
type is a "type class". Instead, Haskell-style type classes are
usually defined as :ref:`record types <record-types>`. For instance,

::

  record Monoid {a} (A : Set a) : Set a where
    field
      mempty : A
      _<>_   : A → A → A

In order to make the fields of the record available as functions taking
instance arguments you can use the special module application

..
  ::
  module monoid-record-open where

::

    open Monoid {{...}} public

This will bring into scope

..
  ::
  module open-prototypes where

::

    mempty : ∀ {a} {A : Set a} {{_ : Monoid A}} → A
    _<>_   : ∀ {a} {A : Set a} {{_ : Monoid A}} → A → A → A

..
  ::
    mempty = undefined
    _<>_   = undefined

Superclass dependencies can be implemented using :ref:`instance-fields`.

See :ref:`module-application` and :ref:`record-modules` for details about how
the module application is desugared. If defined by hand, ``mempty`` would be

..
  ::
  module mempty-by-hand where

::


    mempty : ∀ {a} {A : Set a} {{_ : Monoid A}} → A
    mempty {{mon}} = Monoid.mempty mon

Although record types are a natural fit for Haskell-style type
classes, you can use instance arguments with data types to good
effect. See the :ref:`instance-arguments-examples` below.

.. _declaring-instances:


Declaring instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As seen above, instance arguments in the context are available when solving
instance arguments, but you also need to be able to
define top-level instances for concrete types. This is done using the
``instance`` keyword, which starts a :ref:`block <lexical-structure-layout>` in
which each definition is marked as an instance available for instance
resolution. For example, an instance ``Monoid (List A)`` can be defined as

..
  ::
  module list-monoid where

::

    instance
      ListMonoid : ∀ {a} {A : Set a} → Monoid (List A)
      ListMonoid = record { mempty = []; _<>_ = _++_ }

Or equivalently, using :ref:`copatterns <copatterns>`:

..
  ::
  open Monoid {{...}} public

::

  instance
    ListMonoid : ∀ {a} {A : Set a} → Monoid (List A)
    mempty {{ListMonoid}} = []
    _<>_   {{ListMonoid}} xs ys = xs ++ ys

Top-level instances must target a named type (``Monoid`` in this case), and
cannot be declared for types in the context.

You can define local instances in let-expressions in the same way as a
top-level instance. For example::

  mconcat : ∀ {a} {A : Set a} {{_ : Monoid A}} → List A → A
  mconcat [] = mempty
  mconcat (x ∷ xs) = x <> mconcat xs

  sum : List Nat → Nat
  sum xs =
    let instance
          NatMonoid : Monoid Nat
          NatMonoid = record { mempty = 0; _<>_ = _+_ }
    in mconcat xs

Instances can have instance arguments themselves, which will be filled in
recursively during instance resolution. For instance,

..
  ::
  module eq-list where

::

    record Eq {a} (A : Set a) : Set a where
      field
        _==_ : A → A → Bool

    open Eq {{...}} public

    instance
      eqList : ∀ {a} {A : Set a} {{_ : Eq A}} → Eq (List A)
      _==_ {{eqList}} []       []       = true
      _==_ {{eqList}} (x ∷ xs) (y ∷ ys) = x == y && xs == ys
      _==_ {{eqList}} _        _        = false

      eqNat : Eq Nat
      _==_ {{eqNat}} = natEquals

    ex : Bool
    ex = (1 ∷ 2 ∷ 3 ∷ []) == (1 ∷ 2 ∷ []) -- false

Note the two calls to ``_==_`` in the right-hand side of the second clause. The
first uses the ``Eq A`` instance and the second uses a recursive call to
``eqList``. In the example ``ex``, instance resolution, needing a value of type ``Eq
(List Nat)``, will try to use the ``eqList`` instance and find that it needs an
instance argument of type ``Eq Nat``, it will then solve that with ``eqNat``
and return the solution ``eqList {{eqNat}}``.

.. note::
   At the moment there is no termination check on instances, so it is possible
   to construct non-sensical instances like
   ``loop : ∀ {a} {A : Set a} {{_ : Eq A}} → Eq A``.
   To prevent looping in cases like this, the search depth of instance search
   is limited, and once the maximum depth is reached, a type error will be
   thrown. You can set the maximum depth using the ``--instance-search-depth``
   flag.

Restricting instance search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To restrict an instance to the current module, you can mark it as
`private`. For instance,

..
  ::
  module private-instance where

    open import Agda.Builtin.Equality

::

    record Default (A : Set) : Set where
      field default : A

    open Default {{...}} public

    module M where

      private
        instance
          defaultNat : Default Nat
          defaultNat .default = 6

      test₁ : Nat
      test₁ = default

      _ : test₁ ≡ 6
      _ = refl

    open M

    instance
      defaultNat : Default Nat
      defaultNat .default = 42

    test₂ : Nat
    test₂ = default

    _ : test₂ ≡ 42
    _ = refl

..

Constructor instances
+++++++++++++++++++++

Although instance arguments are most commonly used for record types,
mimicking Haskell-style type classes, they can also be used with data
types. In this case you often want the constructors to be instances,
which is achieved by declaring them inside an ``instance``
block. Constructors can only be declared as instances if all their
arguments are implicit or instance arguments. See
:ref:`instance-resolution` below for the details.

A simple example of a constructor that can be made an instance is the
reflexivity constructor of the equality type::

  data _≡_ {a} {A : Set a} (x : A) : A → Set a where
    instance refl : x ≡ x

..
  ::
  infix 4 _≡_

This allows trivial equality proofs to be inferred by instance resolution,
which can make working with functions that have preconditions less of a burden.
As an example, here is how one could use this to define a function that takes a
natural number and gives back a ``Fin n`` (the type of naturals smaller than
``n``)::

  data Fin : Nat → Set where
    zero : ∀ {n} → Fin (suc n)
    suc  : ∀ {n} → Fin n → Fin (suc n)

  mkFin : ∀ {n} (m : Nat) {{_ : suc m - n ≡ 0}} → Fin n
  mkFin {zero}  m {{}}
  mkFin {suc n} zero    = zero
  mkFin {suc n} (suc m) = suc (mkFin m)

  five : Fin 6
  five = mkFin 5 -- OK

.. code-block: agda
  badfive : Fin 5
  badfive = mkFin 5 -- Error: No instance of type 1 ≡ 0 was found in scope.

In the first clause of ``mkFin`` we use an :ref:`absurd pattern
<absurd-patterns>` to discharge the impossible assumption ``suc m ≡
0``.  See the :ref:`next section <instance-arguments-examples>` for
another example of constructor instances.

Record fields can also be declared instances, with the effect that the
corresponding projection function is considered a top-level instance.

.. _overlapping-instances:

Overlapping instances
+++++++++++++++++++++

By default, Agda does not allow overlapping instances. Two instances
are defined to overlap if they could both solve the instance goal
when given appropriate solutions for their recursive (instance)
arguments.

For example, in code below, the instances `zero` and `suc` overlap for
the goal `ex₁`, because either one of them can be used to solve the
goal when given appropriate arguments, hence instance search fails.

.. code-block:: agda

  infix 4 _∈_
  data _∈_ {A : Set} (x : A) : List A → Set where
    instance
      zero : ∀ {xs} → x ∈ x ∷ xs
      suc  : ∀ {y xs} {{_ : x ∈ xs}} → x ∈ y ∷ xs

  ex₁ : 1 ∈ 1 ∷ 2 ∷ 3 ∷ 4 ∷ []
  ex₁ = it  -- overlapping instances

Overlapping instances can be enabled via the ``--overlapping-instances``
flag.  Be aware that enabling this flag might lead to an exponential
slowdown in instance resolution and possibly (apparent) looping
behaviour.

.. _instance-arguments-examples:

Examples
~~~~~~~~

.. _dependent-instances:

Dependent instances
+++++++++++++++++++

..
  ::
  data Maybe {a} (A : Set a) : Set a where
    nothing : Maybe A
    just    : A → Maybe A

  module dependent-instances where
    open Agda.Primitive

Consider a variant on the ``Eq`` class where the equality function produces a
proof in the case the arguments are equal::

    record Eq {a} (A : Set a) : Set a where
      field
        _==_ : (x y : A) → Maybe (x ≡ y)

    open Eq {{...}} public

A simple boolean-valued equality function is problematic for types with
dependencies, like the Σ-type

::

    data Σ {a b} (A : Set a) (B : A → Set b) : Set (a ⊔ b) where
      _,_ : (x : A) → B x → Σ A B

since given two pairs ``x , y`` and ``x₁ , y₁``, the types of the second
components ``y`` and ``y₁`` can be completely different and not admit an
equality test. Only when ``x`` and ``x₁`` are *really equal* can we hope to
compare ``y`` and ``y₁``. Having the equality function return a proof means
that we are guaranteed that when ``x`` and ``x₁`` compare equal, they really
are equal, and comparing ``y`` and ``y₁`` makes sense.

An ``Eq`` instance for ``Σ`` can be defined as follows::

    instance
      eqΣ : ∀ {a b} {A : Set a} {B : A → Set b} {{_ : Eq A}} {{_ : ∀ {x} → Eq (B x)}} → Eq (Σ A B)
      _==_ {{eqΣ}} (x , y) (x₁ , y₁) with x == x₁
      _==_ {{eqΣ}} (x , y) (x₁ , y₁)    | nothing = nothing
      _==_ {{eqΣ}} (x , y) (.x , y₁)    | just refl with y == y₁
      _==_ {{eqΣ}} (x , y) (.x , y₁)    | just refl    | nothing   = nothing
      _==_ {{eqΣ}} (x , y) (.x , .y)    | just refl    | just refl = just refl

Note that the instance argument for ``B`` states that there should be
an ``Eq`` instance for ``B x``, for any ``x : A``. The argument ``x``
must be implicit, indicating that it needs to be inferred by
unification whenever the ``B`` instance is used. See
:ref:`instance-resolution` below for more details.




.. _instance-resolution:


Instance resolution
-------------------

Given a goal that should be solved using instance resolution we proceed in the
following four stages:

Verify the goal
  First we check that the goal type has the right shape to be solved by instance
  resolution. It should be of the form ``{Γ} → C vs``, where the target type
  ``C`` is a variable from the context or the name of a data or record type,
  and ``{Γ}`` denotes a telescope of implicit arguments. If this is not the
  case instance resolution fails with an error message\ [#issue1322]_.

Find candidates
  In the second stage we compute a set of *candidates*. :ref:`Let-bound
  <let-and-where>` variables and top-level definitions in scope are candidates if they
  are defined in an ``instance`` block. Lambda-bound variables, i.e. variables
  bound in lambdas, function types, left-hand sides, or module parameters, are
  candidates if they are bound as instance arguments using ``{{ }}``.
  Only candidates that compute something of type ``C us``, where ``C`` is the
  target type computed in the previous stage, are considered.

Check the candidates
  We attempt to use each candidate in turn to build an instance of the goal
  type ``{Γ} → C vs``. First we extend the current context by ``Γ``. Then,
  given a candidate ``c : Δ → A`` we generate fresh metavariables ``αs : Δ``
  for the arguments of ``c``, with ordinary metavariables for implicit
  arguments, and instance metavariables, solved by a recursive call to instance
  resolution, for instance arguments.

  Next we :ref:`unify <unification>` ``A[Δ := αs]`` with ``C vs`` and apply
  instance resolution to the instance metavariables in ``αs``. Both unification
  and instance resolution have three possible outcomes: *yes*, *no*, or
  *maybe*. In case we get a *no* answer from any of them, the current candidate
  is discarded, otherwise we return the potential solution ``λ {Γ} → c αs``.

Compute the result
  From the previous stage we get a list of potential solutions. If the list is
  empty we fail with an error saying that no instance for ``C vs`` could be
  found (*no*). If there is a single solution we use it to solve the goal
  (*yes*), and if there are multiple solutions we check if they are all equal.
  If they are, we solve the goal with one of them (*yes*), but if they are not,
  we postpone instance resolution (*maybe*), hoping that some of the *maybes*
  will turn into *nos* once we know more about the involved metavariables.

  If there are left-over instance problems at the end of type checking, the
  corresponding metavariables are printed in the Emacs status buffer together
  with their types and source location. The candidates that gave rise to
  potential solutions can be printed with the :ref:`show constraints command
  <emacs-global-commands>` (``C-c C-=``).

.. [#issue1322] Instance goal verification is buggy at the moment. See `issue
   #1322 <https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/1322>`_.
