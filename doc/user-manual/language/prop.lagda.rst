Prop

``Prop`` is Agda's built-in sort of *definitionally proof-irrelevant
propositions*. It is similar to the sort ``Set``, but all elements of
a type in ``Prop`` are considered to be (definitionally) equal.

The implementation of ``Prop`` is based on the POPL 2019 paper
`Definitional Proof-Irrelevance without K
<https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01859964/>`_ by Gaëtan Gilbert, Jesper Cockx,
Matthieu Sozeau, and Nicolas Tabareau.


Usage
-----

Just as for ``Set``, we can define new types in ``Prop``'s as data or
record types:
::

  data ⊥ : Prop where

  record ⊤ : Prop where
    constructor tt

When defining a function from a data type in ``Prop`` to a type in
``Set``, pattern matching is restricted to the absurd pattern ``()``:
::

  absurd : (A : Set) → ⊥ → A
  absurd A ()

Unlike for ``Set``, all elements of a type in ``Prop`` are
definitionally equal. This implies all applications of ``absurd`` are
the same:
::

  only-one-absurdity : {A : Set} → (p q : ⊥) → absurd A p ≡ absurd A q
  only-one-absurdity p q = refl

Since pattern matching on datatypes in ``Prop`` is limited, it is
recommended to define types in ``Prop`` as recursive functions rather
than inductive datatypes. For example, the relation ``_≤_`` on natural
numbers can be defined as follows:
::

  _≤_ : Nat → Nat → Prop
  zero  ≤ y     = ⊤
  suc x ≤ zero  = ⊥
  suc x ≤ suc y = x ≤ y

The induction principle for ``_≤_`` can then be defined by matching on
the arguments of type ``Nat``:
::

  module _ (P : (m n : Nat) → Set)
    (pzy : (y : Nat) → P zero y)
    (pss : (x y : Nat) → P x y → P (suc x) (suc y)) where

    ≤-ind : (m n : Nat) → m ≤ n → P m n
    ≤-ind zero    y       pf = pzy y
    ≤-ind (suc x) (suc y) pf = pss x y (≤-ind x y pf)
    ≤-ind (suc _) zero    ()

Note that while it is also possible to define _≤_ as a
datatype in Prop, it is hard to use that version because
of the limitations to matching.

When defining a record type in ``Set``, the types of the fields can be
both in ``Set`` and ``Prop``. For example:
::

  record Fin (n : Nat) : Set where
    constructor _[_]
    field
      ⟦_⟧   : Nat
      proof : suc ⟦_⟧ ≤ n
  open Fin

  Fin-≡ : ∀ {n} (x y : Fin n) → ⟦ x ⟧ ≡ ⟦ y ⟧ → x ≡ y
  Fin-≡ x y refl = refl



The predicative hierarchy of ``Prop``
-------------------------------------

Just as for ``Set``, Agda has a predicative hierarchy of sorts
``Prop₀`` (= ``Prop``), ``Prop₁``, ``Prop₂``, ... where ``Prop₀ :
Set₁``, ``Prop₁ : Set₂``, ``Prop₂ : Set₃``, etc. Like ``Set``,
``Prop`` also supports universe polymorphism (see :ref:`universe
levels <universe-levels>`), so for each ``ℓ : Level`` we have the sort
``Prop ℓ``. For example:
::

  True : ∀ {ℓ} → Prop (lsuc ℓ)
  True {ℓ} = ∀ (P : Prop ℓ) → P → P

The propositional squash type
-----------------------------

When defining a datatype in ``Prop ℓ``, it is allowed to have
constructors that take arguments in ``Set ℓ′`` for any ``ℓ′ ≤ ℓ``.
For example, this allows us to define the propositional squash type
and its eliminator:
::

  data Squash {ℓ} (A : Set ℓ) : Prop ℓ where
    squash : A → Squash A

  squash-elim : ∀ {ℓ₁ ℓ₂} (A : Set ℓ₁) (P : Prop ℓ₂) → (A → P) → Squash A → P
  squash-elim A P f (squash x) = f x

This type allows us to simulate Agda's existing irrelevant arguments
(see :ref:`irrelevance <irrelevance>`) by replacing .A with Squash A.

Limitations
-----------

It is possible to define an equality type in Prop as follows:
::

  data _≐_ {ℓ} {A : Set ℓ} (x : A) : A → Prop ℓ where
    refl : x ≐ x

However, the corresponding eliminator cannot be defined because of the
limitations on pattern matching. As a consequence, this equality type
is only useful for refuting impossible equations:
::

  0≢1 : 0 ≐ 1 → ⊥
  0≢1 ()
