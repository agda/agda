Simple datatypes
================

Example datatypes
-----------------

In the introduction we already showed the definition of the data type of natural numbers (in unary notation):
::

  data Nat : Set where
      zero : Nat
      suc  : Nat → Nat

We give a few more examples. First the data type of truth values:
::

  data Bool : Set where
    true  : Bool
    false : Bool

The ``True`` set represents the trivially true proposition:
::

  data True : Set where
      tt : True

The ``False`` set has no constructor and hence no elements. It
represents the trivially false proposition: ::

  data False : Set where

Another example is the data type of non-empty binary trees with natural numbers in the leaves::

  data BinTree : Set where
    leaf   : Nat → BinTree
    branch : BinTree → BinTree → BinTree

Finally, the data type of Brouwer ordinals::

  data Ord : Set where
    zeroOrd : Ord
    sucOrd  : Ord → Ord
    limOrd  : (Nat → Ord) → Ord

General form
------------

The general form of the definition of a simple datatype ``D`` is the
following

.. code-block:: agda

    data D : Setᵢ where
      c₁ : A₁
      ...
      cₙ : Aₙ

The name ``D`` of the data type and the names ``c₁``, ..., ``cₙ`` of
the constructors must be new w.r.t. the current signature and context,
and the types ``A₁``, ..., ``Aₙ`` must be function types ending in
``D``, i.e. they must be of the form

.. code-block:: agda

  (y₁ : B₁) → ... → (yₘ : Bₘ) → D

Parametrized datatypes
======================

Datatypes can have *parameters*. They are declared after the name of the
datatype but before the colon, for example::

  data List (A : Set) : Set where
    []  : List A
    _∷_ : A → List A → List A

Indexed datatypes
=================

In addition to parameters, datatypes can also have *indices*. In
contrast to parameters which are required to be the same for all
constructors, indices can vary from constructor to constructor. They
are declared after the colon as function arguments to ``Set``. For
example, fixed-length vectors can be defined by indexing them over
their length of type ``Nat``::

  data Vector (A : Set) : Nat → Set where
    []  : Vector A zero
    _∷_ : {n : Nat} → A → Vector A n → Vector A (suc n)

Notice that the parameter ``A`` is bound once for all constructors,
while the index ``{n : Nat}`` must be bound locally in the constructor
``_∷_``.

Indexed datatypes can also be used to describe predicates, for example
the predicate ``Even : Nat → Set`` can be defined as follows:
::

  data Even : Nat → Set where
    even-zero  : Even zero
    even-plus2 : {n : Nat} → Even n → Even (suc (suc n))

General form
------------

The general form of the definition of a (parametrized, indexed)
datatype ``D`` is the following

.. code-block:: agda

  data D (x₁ : P₁) ... (xₖ : Pₖ) : (y₁ : Q₁) → ... → (yₗ : Qₗ) → Set ℓ where
    c₁ : A₁
    ...
    cₙ : Aₙ

where the types ``A₁``, ..., ``Aₙ`` are function types of the form

.. code-block:: agda

  (z₁ : B₁) → ... → (zₘ : Bₘ) → D x₁ ... xₖ t₁ ... tₗ


Strict positivity
=================

When defining a datatype ``D``, Agda poses an additional requirement
on the types of the constructors of ``D``, namely that ``D`` may only
occur **strictly positively** in the types of their arguments.

Concretely, for a datatype with constructors ``c₁ : A₁``, ..., ``cₙ :
Aₙ``, Agda checks that each `Aᵢ` has the form

.. code-block:: agda

    (y₁ : B₁) → ... → (yₘ : Bₘ) → D

where an argument types `Bᵢ` of the constructors is either

* *non-inductive* (a *side condition*) and does not mention ``D`` at
  all,

* or *inductive* and has the form

  .. code-block:: agda

     (z₁ : C₁) → ... → (zₖ : Cₖ) → D

  where ``D`` must not occur in any `Cⱼ`.

..
  ::
  module hidden₁ where

The strict positivity condition rules out declarations such as

::

    data Bad : Set where
        bad : (Bad → Bad) → Bad
        --     A     B      C
        -- A is in a negative position, B and C are OK

since there is a negative occurrence of ``Bad`` in the type of the
argument of the constructor.  (Note that the corresponding data type
declaration of ``Bad`` is allowed in standard functional languages
such as Haskell and ML.).

Non strictly-positive declarations are rejected because
they admit non-terminating functions.

If the positivity check is disabled, so that a similar declaration of
``Bad`` is allowed, it is possible to construct a term of the empty
type, even without recursion.

.. code-block:: agda

  {-# OPTIONS --no-positivity-check #-}

::

  data ⊥ : Set where

  data Bad : Set where
    bad : (Bad → ⊥) → Bad

  self-app : Bad → ⊥
  self-app (bad f) = f (bad f)

  absurd : ⊥
  absurd = self-app (bad self-app)
