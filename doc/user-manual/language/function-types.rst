Function Types
**************

Function types are written (x : A) → B, or in the case of non-dependent functions simply A → B. For instance, the type of the addition function for natural numbers is
::
 Nat → Nat → Nat
and the type of the addition function for vectors is:
::
 (A : Set) → (n : Nat) → (u : Vec A n) → (v : Vec A n) → Vec A n
where Set is the type of sets and Vec A n is the type of vectors with n elements of type A. Arrows between consecutive hypotheses of the form (x : A) may also be omitted, and (x : A)(y : A) may be shortened to (x y : A):
::
 (A : Set)(n : Nat)(u v : Vec A n) → Vec A n
Functions are constructed by lambda abstractions, which can be either typed or untyped. For instance, both expressions below have type (A : Set) → A → A (the second expression checks against other types as well):
::
 \ (A : Set)(x : A) → x
 \ A x → x
