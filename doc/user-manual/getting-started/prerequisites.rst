Prerequisites
*************

You need recent versions of the following programs to compile Agda:

* GHC:           https://www.haskell.org/ghc/

  + Agda have been tested with GHC 8.0.2, 8.2.2, 8.4.4 and 8.6.5.

* cabal-install: https://www.haskell.org/cabal/
* Alex:          https://www.haskell.org/alex/
* Happy:         https://www.haskell.org/happy/
* GNU Emacs:     http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/

You should also make sure that programs installed by *cabal-install*
are on your shell's search path.

For instructions on installing a suitable version of Emacs under
Windows, see :ref:`emacs-under-windows`.

Non-Windows users need to ensure that the development files for the C
libraries *zlib** and *ncurses** are installed (see http://zlib.net
and http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/). Your package manager may be
able to install these files for you. For instance, on Debian or Ubuntu
it should suffice to run

.. code-block:: bash

  apt-get install zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev

as root to get the correct files installed.

Optionally one can also install the `ICU
<http://site.icu-project.org>`_ library, which is used to implement
the ``--count-clusters`` flag. Under Debian or Ubuntu it may suffice
to install *libicu-dev*. Once the ICU library is installed one can
hopefully enable the ``--count-clusters`` flag by giving the
``-fenable-cluster-counting`` flag to *cabal install*.

Installing Emacs under Windows
==============================

A precompiled version of Emacs 24.3, with the necessary mathematical
fonts, is available at http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~astump/agda.
