When releasing a new version of Agda, the following procedure can be
followed:

* First, release a release candidate (see
  notes/agda-releases-candidates).

* The $FILES variable represents the files where it is necessary to
  change the version number.

    $FILES=
      .ghci
      Agda.cabal
      default.nix
      doc/user-manual/conf.py
      mk/versions.mk
      src/data/emacs-mode/agda2-mode.el
      src/data/emacs-mode/agda2-mode-pkg.el
      src/size-solver/size-solver.cabal
      test/interaction/Issue1244a.out
      test/interaction/Issue1244b.out

* Update in the bug tracker the milestone field of open issues to the
  next Agda version.

* Verify that the Travis builds have no errors.

* Get a clean Agda repository.

    git clone git@github.com:agda/agda agda-release
    cd agda-release

* If the current version in master is 2.5.0 the versions used in this
  notes are:

    VERSION=<current-version-plus-0.0.1>
    VERSION=2.5.1

    STABLE_BRANCH_VERSION=<two-first-digits-of-the-current-version>
    STABLE_BRANCH_VERSION=2.5

    NEXT_VERSION=<current-version-plus-0.1.0>
    NEXT_VERSION=2.6.0

* Finish the CHANGELOG.

* Update README.md, if necessary.

* Update the LICENSE file, if necessary.

  Note: the list of contributors is duplicated in the following locations:

  - doc/user-manual/license.rst
  - doc/user-manual/conf.py

* Update the version numbers to $VERSION in $FILES.

* Obtain and install the standard library branch related to the Agda
  new version.

    make up-to-date-std-lib

* Add a second source-repository section to Agda.cabal:

    source-repository this
      type:     git
      location: https://github.com/agda/agda.git
      tag:      v$VERSION

* Remove -Werror and -fprof-auto from Agda.cabal (this is required by
  `cabal --check`).

* Run the test-suite:

    make compile-emacs-mode
    make test

  Note that "compile-emacs-mode" invokes "agda-mode compile", which
  should ensure that the Emacs mode can be compiled without errors or
  warnings (except for the "cl package required at runtime" warning).

* Remove the Cabal tests-suites `agda-tests` and `internal-tests` from
  Agda.cabal.

* Build source distributions:

    cabal configure
    cabal check
    cabal sdist

* Ensure that the package builds properly (with multiple versions of GHC if
  possible) in Linux, MacOS X and Windows.

    BASE=`pwd`
    cd ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}
    tar xzf $BASE/dist/Agda-$VERSION.tar.gz
    cd Agda-$VERSION
    cabal install

  Do not forget to test:

  ** The Emacs mode

* Tag the release (do not forget to record the changes above first):

    cd $BASE
    git tag -a v$VERSION -m "Agda $VERSION release"

* Upload the Cabal package:

    cd $BASE
    cabal upload dist/Agda-$VERSION.tar.gz

* Is the documentation missing on Hackage (see #1940)? You can use the
  `neil` program for uploading the documentation:

    neil doc --username=YourHackageUsername

* Restore the Cabal tests-suites `agda-tests` and `internal-tests`
  from Agda.cabal.

* Restore -Werror and -fprof-auto in Agda.cabal.

* Remove the "this" source-repository section from the Cabal
  file. (This would be unnecessary if we had two repositories, one
  stable and one for development.)

* Stable branch

  ** Create the stable branch

       git checkout -b stable-$STABLE_BRANCH_VERSION

  ** Update the version numbers to $VERSION.1 in $FILES.

  ** Add into the Makefile:

      # --program-suffix is not for the executable name in
      # $(BUILD_DIR)/build/, only for installing it into .cabal/bin
      override CABAL_OPTS+=--program-suffix=-$(VERSION)

      AGDA_MODE=agda-mode-$(VERSION)

  ** Added stable-$STABLE_BRANCH_VERSION to the branches whitelist in
     .travis.yml.

  ** Update with stable-$STABLE_BRANCH_VERSION the branch used for
     reporting the build status in README.md.

  ** Add a new header to CHANGELOG.

  ** Commit the above changes.

  ** Merge the stable-$STABLE_BRANCH_VERSION branch.

       git checkout master
       git merge stable-$STABLE_BRANCH_VERSION

* Update the version numbers to $NEXT_VERSION in $FILES.

* Remove from the Makefile:

    # --program-suffix is not for the executable name in
    # $(BUILD_DIR)/build/, only for installing it into .cabal/bin
    override CABAL_OPTS+=--program-suffix=-$(VERSION)

    AGDA_MODE=agda-mode-$(VERSION)

* Update with `master` the branch used for reporting the build status
  in README.md.

* Remove the release notes for the released version from
  doc/release-notes and create a template for the next version.

* Push all changes

    git push --follow-tags
    git checkout stable-$STABLE_BRANCH_VERSION
    git push -u origin stable-$STABLE_BRANCH_VERSION

* Disable force push on the stable-$STABLE_BRANCH_VERSION branch, see

  https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/
  https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/settings/branches

* Update the Agda Wiki:

  ** Update the Download page:

     *** Move the current version information to the old releases
         section.

     *** Update the last release information.

     *** Update the stable version information.

  ** Update the Main page.

* Update Agda Manual on Readthedocs.org

  * You need Admin permissions on the Agda readthedocs.org project
    (current admins: asr, andreasabel, phile314)

  * Go to readthedocs.org -> Agda Project -> Admin -> Versions

  * Mark $VERSION as active

  * Set the default documentation version to $VERSION

* Announce the release of the new version on the Agda mailing lists
  (users and developers).

* Close in the bug tracker the milestone $VERSION.
