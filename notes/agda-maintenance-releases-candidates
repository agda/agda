When releasing a release candidate (RC) bugfix version of Agda, the
following procedure can be followed:

* Can we use HACKAGE for realising a release candidate? That is, are
  the issues mentioned in

    https://github.com/haskell/hackage-server/issues/41

  fixed?

* Update in the bug tracker the milestone field of open issues to the
  next Agda version.

* Verify that the Travis builds have no errors.

* Get a clean Agda repository.

    MAJORVERSION=<current-Agda-version-eg-2.4.2>
    VERSION=<current-maintenance-version-eg-2.4.0.2>
    git clone git@github.com:agda/agda.git agda.release
    cd agda.release
    git checkout maint-$MAJORVERSION

* The version of the RC is the current version released + current date

    RC_VERSION=<current-released-version-current-date-eg-2.4.2.3.20150913

* Change VERSION to RC_VERSION in:

    Agda.cabal (twice)
    mk/version.mk
    src/data/emacs-mode/agda2-mode.el
    test/interaction/Issue1244a.out
    test/interaction/Issue1244b.out

* Obtain and install the standard library branch related to the Agda
  bugfix version:

    make up-to-date-std-lib

* Finish the CHANGELOG.

* Update the README.md, if necessary.

* Update the LICENSE file, if necessary.

* Remove -Werror and -fprof-auto from Agda.cabal (this is required by
  `cabal --check`).

* Run the test-suite:

    make install
    make test

  Note that "make install" invokes "agda-mode compile", which should
  ensure that the Emacs mode can be compiled without errors or
  warnings (except for the "cl package required at runtime" warning).

* Remove the Cabal test-suite from Agda.cabal.

* Build source distributions:

    cabal configure
    cabal check
    cabal sdist
    cabal install

* Ensure that the package builds properly (with multiple versions of GHC if
  possible) in Linux, MacOS X and Windows.

    BASE=`pwd`
    RC_VERSION=<rc_version>
    cd ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}
    tar xzf $BASE/dist/Agda-$RC_VERSION.tar.gz
    cd Agda-$RC_VERSION
    cabal install

  Do not forget to test the Emacs mode.

* Tag the relase candidate (do not forget to record the changes above
  first):

    cd $BASE
    git tag -a $RC_VERSION -m "Agda $VERSION release candidate"

* Restore the Cabal test-suite in Agda.cabal.

* Restore -Werror and -fprof-auto in Agda.cabal.

* Restore the version number VERSION in:

    Agda.cabal (twice)
    src/data/emacs-mode/agda2-mode.el
    mk/version.mk
    test/interaction/Issue1244a.out
    test/interaction/Issue1244b.out

* Push all changes and merge into 'master' branch (requires Git >= 1.8.3).

    git push --follow-tags

    git checkout master
    git merge maint-$MAJORVERSION

* Push master

    git push

* Announce the release candidate on the Agda mailing lists (users and
  developers).

  Note that the announce shouldn't include

    https://github.com/agda/agda/releases/tag/$RC_VERSION.tar.gz

  but $BASE/dist/Agda-$RC_VERSION.tar.gz.
