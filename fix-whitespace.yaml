# fix-whitespace determines the set of directories first and
# then the set of filenames inside those directories.
#
# The extended glob pattern can be used to specify file/direcotory names.
# For details, see http://hackage.haskell.org/package/filemanip-0.3.6.3/docs/System-FilePath-GlobPattern.html
#
# By default, fix-whitespace checks every directory under the current working directory
#
#
# Every directory matched by excluded-dirs is excluded unless it is included by included-dirs.
included-dirs:
  - src/full/Agda/Compiler/MAlonzo # Without this line it will be excluded.

excluded-dirs:
  - "**MAlonzo" # matches every MAlonzo in any directory including the src/full/Agda/Compiler/MAlonzo
  - "**dist*"   # matches every dist* in any directory
  - .stack-work
  - _darcs
  - .git
  - std-lib
  - test/bugs

# Every matched filename is included unless it is matched by excluded-files.
