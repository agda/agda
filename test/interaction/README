Test framework for interactions
-------------------------------

- 'make interaction' runs the interaction tests (also part of 'make test')
- Most tests consist of an agda file SomeTest.agda and an interaction
  script SomeTest.in. The interaction script contains interactions (as
  commands to the Agda2 interpreter) that should be performed on the Agda
  file.
- A simple example:
    top_command    (cmd_load currentFile [])
    goal_command 0 (cmd_goal_type_context Normalised) ""
    goal_command 0 cmd_give "s z"
    goal_command 0 cmd_give "Nothing"
  The variable currentFile is bound to the current file name.
- Two macros are available for convenience: currentFile, top_command and goal_command.
  "currentFile" is replaced by the current file path by sed in the Makefile.
          top_command <command>
  is replaced by
          ioTCM currentFile None <command>
  and
          goal_command <i> <goalcommand> <s>
  is the same as
          ioTCM currentFile None <goalcommand> <i> noRange <s>
- The output from each test is recorded in SomeTest.out and compared
  against for each run of the test.

- If the framework above is too limited, then one can use script-files
  named SomeTest.script instead of SomeTest.in. These files can
  contain arbitrary Bash code.
