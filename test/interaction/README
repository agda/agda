Test framework for interactions
-------------------------------

- 'make interaction' runs the interaction tests (also part of 'make test')
- Each test consists of an agda file SomeTest.agda and a interaction
  script SomeTest.in. The interaction script contains interactions (as
  commands to the Agda2 interpreter) that should be performed on the Agda
  file.
- A simple example:
    top_command    (cmd_load currentFile [])
    goal_command 0 (cmd_goal_type_context Normalised) ""
    goal_command 0 cmd_give "s z"
    goal_command 0 cmd_give "Nothing"
  The variable currentFile is bound to the current file name.
- Some new functions have been added to Agda.Interaction.GhciTop for
  convenience:
    top_command' :: FilePath -> Interaction -> IO ()
    goal_command :: InteractionId -> GoalCommand -> String -> IO ()
- The output from each test is recorded in SomeTest.out and compared
  against for each run of the test.
