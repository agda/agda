Issue4333/N.agda:6.1-25: error: [RewriteMissingRule]
Global confluence check failed: Issue4333.M.a unfolds to
Issue4333.M.a₁' which should further unfold to Issue4333.M.a₀' but
it does not.
Possible fix: add a rule to rewrite Issue4333.M.a₁' to
Issue4333.M.a₀'
when scope checking the declaration
open import Issue4333.N1
