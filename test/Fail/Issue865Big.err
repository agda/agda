Issue865Big.agda:9,7-11
I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor refl,
because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
  A ≟ A
Possible reason why unification failed:
  Cannot eliminate reflexive equation A = A of type Set because K has
  been disabled.
when checking that the pattern refl has type A ≡ A
