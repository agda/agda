Issue765.agda:63,11-15
I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor refl,
because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
  to m ≟ to n
Possible reason why unification failed:
  Cannot eliminate reflexive equation ⊥-elim = ⊥-elim of type
  Position
  (constC ((Shape C ◃ Position C) ⋆ X) ⊎C Shape C ◃ Position C)
  (inj₁ m) →
  μ (constC ((Shape C ◃ Position C) ⋆ X) ⊎C Shape C ◃ Position C)
  because K has been disabled.
when checking that the pattern refl has type to m ≡ to n
