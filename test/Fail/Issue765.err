Issue765.agda:63,11-15: error: [SplitError.UnificationStuck]
I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor refl,
because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
  to m ≟ to n
Possible reason why unification failed:
  Cannot eliminate reflexive equation ⊥-elim = ⊥-elim of type
  Position (constC (C ⋆ X) ⊎C C) (inj₁ m) → μ (constC (C ⋆ X) ⊎C C)
  because K has been disabled.
when checking that the pattern refl has type to m ≡ to n
