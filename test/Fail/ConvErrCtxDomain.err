ConvErrCtxDomain.agda:11.7-8: error: [UnequalTerms]
The terms
  idh {x = ⦃ x = x₁ : A ⦄ → B x₁}
and
  idh {x = (x₁ : A) → B x₁}
are not equal at type Set, because:
  the mismatched terms are function types; one takes an instance
  argument, while the other takes a visible argument.
when checking that the expression x has type idh
