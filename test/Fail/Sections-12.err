Sections-12.agda:4,1-14
Could not parse the left-hand side m test_test n
Operators used in the grammar:
  test_test (infix operator, level 20) [_test_test_ (Sections-12.agda:3,1-12)]
(the treatment of operators was changed in Agda 2.5.1, so code that
used to parse may have to be changed)
when scope checking the left-hand side m test_test n in the
definition of _test_test_
