Issue4986b.agda:14,9-13
I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor refl,
because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
  g ≟ λ (@0 x) (@0 y) → f y x
Possible reason why unification failed:
  Cannot solve variable g of type @0 A → @0 A → A with solution
  λ (@0 x) (@0 y) → f y x because the solution cannot be used at
  relevant, unrestricted modality
when checking that the pattern refl has type
g ≡ (λ (@0 x) (@0 y) → f y x)
