Issue755.agda:19,6-10: error: [SplitError.UnificationStuck]
I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor refl,
because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
  foo b 0 ≟ foo b 1
when checking that the pattern refl has type foo b 0 ≡ foo b 1
