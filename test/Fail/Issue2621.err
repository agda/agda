Issue2621.agda:17,13-15
I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor [],
because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
  {zero} ≟ {_k_61 (R = R) (h = h)}
  [] ≟ a
  [] ≟ b
when checking that the pattern [] has type All₂ R a b
