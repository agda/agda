      I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor [],
      because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
      problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
        {zero} ≟ {_k_61 (R = R) (h = h)}
        [] ≟ a
        [] ≟ b
      when checking that the pattern [] has type All₂ R a b
    (blocked on _k_61)
