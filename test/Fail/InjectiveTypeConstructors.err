InjectiveTypeConstructors.agda:10,6-10: error: [SplitError.UnificationStuck]
I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor refl,
because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
  D A ≟ D B
when checking that the pattern refl has type D A == D B
