Failed to solve the following constraints:

      I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor conC,
      because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
      problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
        conB b ≟ _11 (a1 = a1) (a2 = a2) (a3 = a3)
      when checking that the pattern conC b has type
      C a1 (_11 (a1 = a1) (a2 = a2) (a3 = a3))
    (blocked on _11)
