Sections-7.agda:6,7-13
Don't know how to parse _+ Set. Could mean any one of:
  _+ Set
  _+ Set (section)
Operators used in the grammar:
  _+ (prefix operator section, level 20) [_+_ (Sections-7.agda:2,3-6)]
(the treatment of operators was changed in Agda 2.5.1, so code that
used to parse may have to be changed)
when scope checking _+ Set
