Sections-1.agda:9,8-26
Could not parse the application _* 5 ∘ 6 +_ ∘ 2 ∸_
Operators used in the grammar:
  _* (prefix operator section, level 7)  [_*_ (agda-default-include-path/Agda/Builtin/Nat.agda:29,1-4)]
  +_ (postfix operator section, level 6) [_+_ (agda-default-include-path/Agda/Builtin/Nat.agda:16,1-4)]
  ∘  (infixr operator, level 9)          [_∘_ (Sections-1.agda:5,1-4)]                                               
  ∸_ (postfix operator section, level 6) [_-_ (agda-default-include-path/Agda/Builtin/Nat.agda:22,1-4)]
(the treatment of operators was changed in Agda 2.5.1, so code that
used to parse may have to be changed)
when scope checking _* 5 ∘ 6 +_ ∘ 2 ∸_
