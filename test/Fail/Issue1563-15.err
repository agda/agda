Issue1563-15.agda:23.15-28: warning: -W[no]RewriteVariablesBoundInSingleton
I am not certain that the rewrite rule   Circle-loop-β   is safe
because it appears that the following variable is only bound in
contexts which might become definitionally singular:
  loop*
This warning can be silenced with
  -WnoRewriteVariablesBoundInSingleton
but be aware that this rewrite might behave strangely in the
presence of e.g. eta records with no fields
when checking the pragma REWRITE Circle-loop-β

The terms
  ap (Circle-rec (Circle → Circle) (λ y → y) idp x) loop
