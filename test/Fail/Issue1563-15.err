Issue1563-15.agda:23.15-28: warning: -W[no]RewriteVariablesBoundUnsafely
I am not certain that the rewrite rule:  Circle-loop-β  is safe because it appears that the following variables:  loop*  are only bound in contexts which might become definitionally singular.
This warning can be silenced with -WnoRewriteVariablesBoundUnsafely, but be aware that this rewrite might behave strangely in the presence of e.g. eta records with no fields.

The terms
  ap (Circle-rec (Circle → Circle) (λ y → y) idp x) loop
and
  idp
are not equal at type Circle-rec (Circle → Circle) (λ y → y) idp x

                      == Circle-rec (Circle → Circle) (λ y → y) idp x base
when checking that the expression idp has type
ap (Circle-rec (Circle → Circle) (λ y → y) idp x) loop == idp
