  ap (Circle-rec (Circle → Circle) (λ y → y) idp x) loop
and
  idp
are not equal at type Circle-rec (Circle → Circle) (λ y → y) idp x
                      base
                      == Circle-rec (Circle → Circle) (λ y → y) idp x base
when checking that the expression idp has type
ap (Circle-rec (Circle → Circle) (λ y → y) idp x) loop == idp
