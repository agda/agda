Issue6017.agda:24.1-13: error: [UnequalTerms]
The terms
  hcomp {φ = (~ j ∨ j) ∨ ~ i ∨ i} _ _
and
  hcomp {φ = ~ j ∨ j} (λ { i₁ (j = i0) → p i0 ; i₁ (j = i1) → p i₁ })
  (p j)
are not equal at type T
when checking that a clause of f has the correct boundary.

Specifically, the terms
  comp
  (λ i .o → f ((λ { i₁ (j = i0) → p i0 ; i₁ (j = i1) → p i₁ }) i _))
  (refl (p j))
and
  refl (surf i0 j)
must be equal, since f (surf i0 j) could reduce to either.
