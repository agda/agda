Issue160.agda:13,7-11: error: [SplitError.UnificationStuck]
I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor refl,
because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
  f a ≟ f b
when checking that the pattern refl has type f a ≡ f b
