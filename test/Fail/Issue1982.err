      I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor up,
      because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
      problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
        {suc (suc n)} ≟ {_n_99}
        (! t) ∶ (t ∶ A) ≟ A₁
      when checking that the pattern up j has type True Γ A
    (blocked on _n_99)
