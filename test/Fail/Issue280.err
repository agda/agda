Issue280.agda:8,19-26: error: [SplitError.UnificationStuck]
I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor model,
because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
  M c ≟ C
Possible reason why unification failed:
  Cannot solve variable C of type Set with solution M c because the
  variable occurs in the solution, or in the type of one of the
  variables in the solution.
when checking that the pattern model c has type PreModel C M C
