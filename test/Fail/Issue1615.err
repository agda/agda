Issue1615.agda:13.33-35: error: [CannotSolveSizeConstraints]
Cannot solve size constraints
[i, j, n, k, m] k < i, j < i |- k ≤ _12
[i, j, n, k, m] k < i, j < i |- j ≤ _12
[i, j, n, k, m] k < i, j < i |- (↑ _12) ≤ i
Reason: size constraint i+1 ≤ i is inconsistent
when checking that the expression i' has type Size< i
