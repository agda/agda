Issue5929.agda:42,15-31: warning: -W[no]RewriteVariablesBoundUnsafely
I am not certain that the rewrite rule:  circle-elim-loop  is safe because it appears that the following variables:  loopᴾ  are only bound in contexts which might become definitionally singular.
This warning can be silenced with -WnoRewriteVariablesBoundUnsafely, but be aware that this rewrite might behave strangely in the presence of e.g. eta records with no fields.
when checking the pragma REWRITE circle-elim-loop
