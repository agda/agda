Issue978.agda:28.1-13: error: [AmbiguousParseForLHS]
Don't know how to parse test (ε , a). Could mean any one of:
  test (_,_ ε a)
  test (_,_ ε a)
Operators used in the grammar:
  , (infixl operator, level 2) [_,_ (Issue978.agda:21.5-8)] 
  , (infixr operator, level 4) [_,_ (Issue978.agda:8.17-20)]
when scope checking the left-hand side test (ε , a) in the
definition of test
