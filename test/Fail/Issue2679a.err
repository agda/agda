      I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor conC,
      because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
      problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
        conB bl br ≟ _15 (a = a) (b = b)
      when checking that the pattern conC tl tr has type
      C a (_15 (a = a) (b = b))
    (blocked on _15)
