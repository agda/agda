Issue1436-24.agda:30,7-16
Don't know how to parse • + • + •. Could mean any one of:
  (• + •) + •
  • + (• + •)
  (• + •) + •
  (• + •) + •
  • + (• + •)
  • + (• + •)
  (• + •) + •
  (• + •) + •
Operators used in the grammar:
  + (infixl operator, level 0) [_+_ (Issue1436-24.agda:9,5-8)] 
  + (infixl operator, level 1) [_+_ (Issue1436-24.agda:17,5-8)]
  + (infix operator, level 20) [_+_ (Issue1436-24.agda:23,5-8)]
(the treatment of operators was changed in Agda 2.5.1, so code that
used to parse may have to be changed)
when scope checking • + • + •
