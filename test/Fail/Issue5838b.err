Issue5838b.agda:219.1-7: error: [UnequalTerms]
The terms
  false
and
  true
are not equal at type Bool
when checking that a clause of bad' has the correct boundary.

Specifically, the terms
  false
and
  transp
  (λ i →
     DoubleCover (transp (twisted-square' i) (i1 ∧ i ∨ ~ i) base))
  i0 false
must be equal, since bad' i1 could reduce to either.
