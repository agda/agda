Issue1003.agda:7.18-21: warning: -W[no]InstanceNoOutputTypeName
Instance arguments whose type is not {Γ} → C, where C evaluates to
a postulated type, a parameter type or the name of a data or record
type, are never considered by instance search, so having an
instance argument ⦃ T : Set ⦄ has no effect.
when checking that the expression ⦃ T : Set ⦄ → T → Set is a type

Instance search can only be used to find elements in a named type
when checking that y is a valid argument to a function of type
⦃ T : Set ⦄ → T → Set
