Issue3848.agda:19,13-17
Global confluence check failed: f (c f₁) can be rewritten to either
f₁ or f r.
Possible fix: add a rewrite rule with left-hand side f (c f₁) to
resolve the ambiguity.

with rew₁
Issue3848.agda:30,1-21
Global confluence check failed: g (f r) unfolds to g a which should

Possible fix: add a rule to rewrite g a to a, or change the order
of the rules so more specialized rules come later.
