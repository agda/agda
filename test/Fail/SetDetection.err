SetDetection.agda:6,6-10: error: [SplitError.UnificationStuck]
I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor refl,
because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
  x ≟ x
Possible reason why unification failed:
  Cannot eliminate reflexive equation x = x of type Nat because K has
  been disabled.
when checking that the pattern refl has type x ≡ x
