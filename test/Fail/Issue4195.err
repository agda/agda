Issue4195.agda:8,7-11
I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor refl,
because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
  n + 0 ≟ m
Possible reason why unification failed:
  Cannot solve variable m of type Nat with solution n + 0 because the
  solution cannot be used at relevant, unrestricted modality
when checking that the pattern refl has type n + 0 ≡ m
