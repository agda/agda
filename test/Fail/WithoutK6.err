WithoutK6.agda:11,45-59: error: [SplitError.UnificationStuck]
I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor refl,
because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
  x ≟ refl a
  x ≟ refl a
Possible reasons why unification failed:
  Cannot apply injectivity to the equation refl a = refl a of type
  _≡_ {A} a a because I cannot generalize over the indices [a, a].
  Cannot eliminate reflexive equation refl a = refl a of type
  _≡_ {A} a a because K has been disabled.
when checking that the pattern refl .(refl a) has type
_≡_ {_≡_ {A} a a} (refl a) (refl a)
