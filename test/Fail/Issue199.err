      I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor p,
      because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
      problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
        {D} ≟ {_T_13}
        d ≟ _15
      when checking that the pattern p _ has type P _15
    (blocked on any(_A_12, _T_13, _15))
  D A =< _T_13 _A_12 (blocked on _T_13)
