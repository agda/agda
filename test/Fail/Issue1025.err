Issue1025.agda:15,10-14: error: [SplitError.UnificationStuck]
I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor refl,
because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
  foo ≟ foo
Possible reasons why unification failed:
  Cannot apply injectivity to the equation foo = foo of type Foo refl
  because I cannot generalize over the indices [refl].
  Cannot eliminate reflexive equation foo = foo of type Foo refl
  because K has been disabled.
when checking that the pattern refl has type foo ≡ foo
