Issue3655b.agda:19,9-10
Variable generalization failed.
  - Probable cause
      There were unsolved constraints that obscured the dependencies
      between the generalized variables.
  - Suggestion
      The most reliable solution is to provide enough information to make
      the dependencies clear, but simply mentioning the variables in the
      right order should also work.
  - Further information
    - Dependency analysis suggested this (likely incorrect) order: x b
    - After constraint solving it looks like x actually depends on b
    - The dependency I error is

      Cannot instantiate the metavariable _x.b_21 to solution b
      since it contains the variable genTel
      which is not in scope of the metavariable
when checking that the expression D x → (P : F b → Set) → P x is a
