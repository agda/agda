data _≡_ (A : Set₁) : Set₁ → Set₂ where

  A : Set₁
  A = Set

  unfold-A : A ≡ _

-- I don't think we should solve the meta-variable corresponding to
-- the underscore above. We have two obvious choices, A and Set, and
-- these choices are not equivalent.

-- Meta-Variable should remain unsolved

-- Also for private definitions

  unfold-A-private : A ≡ _
  unfold-A-private = refl

-- Also for aliases

  B = Set

  C : _
  C = Set
