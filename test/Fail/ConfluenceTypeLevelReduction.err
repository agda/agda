Couldn't determine overlap between left-hand sides
f _u_18 (b _u_18) and f _u_18 (a _u_18)
because of unsolved constraints:
  b _u_18 = a _u_18 : A _u_18
when checking confluence of the rewrite rule f-b with f-a

false != true of type Bool
when checking that the inferred type of an application
  f unit (a unit) ≡ f unit (b unit)
matches the expected type
  true ≡ false
