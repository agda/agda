Issue5448-3.agda:8,9-13
This clause has target type P x which is not usable at the required
modality @ω.

Note: to maintain compatibility with Cubical Agda, the target type
must be usable at the modality in which the function was defined,
since it will be used for computing transports

when checking that the pattern refl has type x ≡ y
