Issue1436-11.agda:16,7-14
Don't know how to parse ! X , X. Could mean any one of:
  ! (I X X)
  H (! X) X
Operators used in the grammar:
  ! (prefix operator, level 1) [!_ (Issue1436-11.agda:3,3-5)]
  , (infix notation, level 0)  [H (Issue1436-11.agda:2,3-4)] 
  , (infix notation, level 20) [I (Issue1436-11.agda:2,5-6)] 
(the treatment of operators was changed in Agda 2.5.1, so code that
used to parse may have to be changed)
when scope checking ! X , X
