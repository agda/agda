Issue5468.agda:33,1-16
This clause has target type primTransp (λ i → x i) φ (unbox [ x₁ ])
which is not usable at the required modality @ω.

Note: in Cubical Agda, the target type must be usable at the
modality in which the function was defined, since it will be used
for computing transports

when checking the definition of unbox
