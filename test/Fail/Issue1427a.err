Issue1427a.agda:25,32-36
I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor refl,
because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
  Fin (suc n) ≟ Fin (suc n₁)
  zero ≟ zero
when checking that the pattern refl has type
HEq (Fin (suc n)) zero (Fin (suc n₁)) zero
