      I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor zero,
      because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
      problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
        suc n ≟ _m_23 (A = A) (X = X)
      when checking that the pattern zero n has type
      Fin (_m_23 (A = A) (X = X))
    (blocked on any(_18, _m_23))
