Issue1436-10.agda:17,7-14
Don't know how to parse ! X , X. Could mean any one of:
  ! (H X X)
  ! (F λ X → X)
Operators used in the grammar:
  !  (prefix operator, level 1) [!_ (Issue1436-10.agda:4,3-5)]
  _, (prefix notation, level 2) [F (Issue1436-10.agda:2,3-4)] 
  ,  (infix notation, level 20) [H (Issue1436-10.agda:3,3-4)] 
(the treatment of operators was changed in Agda 2.5.1, so code that
used to parse may have to be changed)
when scope checking ! X , X
