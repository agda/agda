LiteralConflict.agda:5,6-10: error: [ImpossibleConstructor.UnifyConflict]
The case for the constructor refl is impossible
because unification ended with a conflicting equation
  "foo" ≟ "bar"
Possible solution: remove the clause, or use an absurd pattern ().
when checking that the pattern refl has type "foo" ≡ "bar"
