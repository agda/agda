Confluence check failed: id unit x (f x) reduces to both g x and
f x which are not equal because g x != f x of type B x
when checking confluence of the rewrite rule f≡g′ with
RewriteExt-confluence.id-clause1
RewriteExt-confluence.agda:32,17-21
Couldn't determine overlap between left-hand sides
id _u_32 _x_33 (_f_29 _x_33) and id _u_32 _x_33 (_f_38 _x_33)
because of unsolved constraints:
  [50, 60] _f_29 _x_33 = _f_38 _x_33 : _B_28 _x_33
when checking confluence of the rewrite rule f≡g′ with itself
