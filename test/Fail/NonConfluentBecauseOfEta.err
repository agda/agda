NonConfluentBecauseOfEta.agda:15.13-20: error: [RewriteMaybeNonConfluent]
Couldn't determine overlap between left-hand sides f (λ _ → _c_19)
and f (λ z → z) because of unsolved constraints:
  _c_19 = x : _A_18 (blocked on any(_A_18, _c_19))
when checking confluence of the rewrite rule f-const with f-id
