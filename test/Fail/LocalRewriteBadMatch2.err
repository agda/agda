LocalRewriteBadMatch2.agda:11.7-11: error: [SplitError.UnificationStuck]
I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor refl,
because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
  f ≟ λ x → x
Possible reason why unification failed:
  Cannot solve variable f of type Nat → Nat with solution λ x → x
  because the variable occurs in a local rewrite rule.
when checking that the pattern refl has type f ≡ (λ x → x)
