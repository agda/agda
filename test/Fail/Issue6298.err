Issue6298.agda:10,19-23
The argument P has type
  (y : A) → x ≡ y → Set
which is not usable at the required modality @ω.

Note: to maintain compatibility with Cubical Agda, this argument's
type must be usable at the modality in which the function was
defined, since it will be used for computing transports

when checking that the pattern refl has type xyz ≡ x
