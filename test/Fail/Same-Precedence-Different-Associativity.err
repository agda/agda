Same-Precedence-Different-Associativity.agda:20,22-31
Could not parse the application 1 + 0 ∸ 1
Operators used in the grammar:
  + (infixl operator, level 6) [_+_ (Same-Precedence-Different-Associativity.agda:10,1-4)]
  ∸ (infix operator, level 6)  [_∸_ (Same-Precedence-Different-Associativity.agda:14,1-4)]
(the treatment of operators was changed in Agda 2.5.1, so code that
used to parse may have to be changed)
when scope checking 1 + 0 ∸ 1
