Issue5531.agda:28.15-26: warning: -W[no]RewriteVariablesBoundInSingleton
I am not certain that the rewrite rule:  idTel-sigma  is safe because it appears that the following variables:  a₁ , a₀ , δ₁ , δ₀  are only bound in contexts which might become definitionally singular.
This warning can be silenced with -WnoRewriteVariablesBoundInSingleton, but be aware that this rewrite might behave strangely in the presence of e.g. eta records with no fields.
