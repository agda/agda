-- No inverse should be created for swap by

swap : ∀{A B : Set} → A × B → B × A
swap (a , b) = b , a

-- The internal representation is
--
--   swap p = (snd p, fst p)

-- so trying to use injectivity is pointless here.

-- The expected output should mention that injectivity for swap is pointless.

-- Injectivity of ConstructorHeadedPointlessForRecordPatterns.swap would be pointless.

-- Crash after typechecking swap.  KEEP!
