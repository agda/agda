Issue1944-instance.agda:23.14-20: error: [AmbiguousOverloadedProjection]
Cannot resolve overloaded projection test because
principal argument x has type A while it should be of record type
  candidates in scope:
- test : ({A = A₁ : Set} → Testable A₁ → A₁ → Bool)
- test : ({A = A₁ : Set} ⦃ r : Testable A₁ ⦄ → A₁ → Bool)
Issue1944-instance.Testable.test is in scope as
  * a record field Issue1944-instance.Testable.test
    brought into scope by
    - the opening of Testable at Issue1944-instance.agda:17.6-14
    - its definition at Issue1944-instance.agda:15.5-9
  * a record field Issue1944-instance._.test brought into scope by
    - the application of Testable at Issue1944-instance.agda:16.6-14
    - its definition at Issue1944-instance.agda:15.5-9
when checking that the expression test x has type Bool
