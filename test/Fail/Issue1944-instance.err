Issue1944-instance.agda:23,14-20
Cannot resolve overloaded projection test because
principal argument x has type A while it should be of record type
  candidates in scope:
- test : ({A = A₁ : Set} ⦃ r : Testable A₁ ⦄ → A₁ → Bool)
- test : ({A = A₁ : Set} → Testable A₁ → A₁ → Bool)
when checking that the expression test x has type Bool
