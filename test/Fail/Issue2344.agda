-- Andreas, 2016-12-19, issue #2344, reported by oinkium, shrunk by Ulf
-- The function Agda.TypeChecking.Telescope.permuteTel
-- used in the unifier was buggy.

-- The underscore in the type signature is originally dependent on A,X,i
-- but then pruned to be dependent on A,X only.
-- The unifier had a problem with this.
toNat-injective : ∀ (A : Set) X i → T (toNat _ i)  -- Yellow expected.
toNat-injective A X (zero n) = mkT

-- Should pass.

-- Jesper, 2017-08-13: This test case now fails since instantiation
-- of metavariables during case splitting was disabled (see #2621).
