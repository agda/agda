warning: -W[no]InstanceNoOutputTypeName
Instance arguments whose type is not {Γ} → C, where C evaluates to
a postulated type, a parameter type or the name of a data or record
type, are never considered by instance search, so having an
instance argument ⦃ _ : Set ⦄ has no effect.
when checking that the expression ⦃ _ : Set ⦄ → Set is a type
