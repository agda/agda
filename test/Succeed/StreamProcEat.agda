{- Agda can check termination of Stream transducer operations.
   (Created: Andreas Abel, 2008-12-01
    at Agda Intensive Meeting 9 in Sendai, Japan.
    I acknowledge the support by AIST and JST.)

Stream transducers have been described in:

  N. Ghani, P. Hancock, and D. Pattinson,
  Continuous functions on final coalgebras.
  In Proc. CMCS 2006, Electr. Notes in Theoret. Comp. Sci., 2006.

They have been modelled by mixed equi-(co)inductive sized types in

  A. Abel,
  Mixed Inductive/Coinductive Types and Strong Normalization.
  In APLAS 2007, LNCS 4807.

Here we model them by mutual data/codata and mutual recursion/corecursion.
