{- | The occurs check for unification.  Does pruning on the fly.

  When hitting a meta variable:

  - Compute flex/rigid for its arguments.
  - Compare to allowed variables.
  - Mark arguments with rigid occurrences of disallowed variables for deletion.
  - Attempt to delete marked arguments.
  - We don't need to check for success, we can just continue occurs checking.

When doing the occurs check on d, we need to look at the definition of
d to discover that it mentions X.

To this end, we extend the state by names of definitions that have to
be checked when they occur.  At the beginning, this is initialized
with the names in the current mutual block.  Each time we encounter a
name in the list during occurs check, we delete it (if check is
successful).  This way, we do not duplicate work.
