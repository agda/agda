-- | @match'@ tries to solve the matching problems on the @Stack@.
--   In each iteration, the top problem is removed and handled.
--
--   If the top problem was a @Done@, we succeed.
--
--   If the top problem was a @Case n@ and the @n@th argument of the problem
--   is not a constructor or literal, we are stuck, thus, fail.
--
--   If we have a branch for the constructor/literal, we put it on the stack
--   to continue.
--   If we do not have a branch, we fall through to the next problem, which
--   should be the corresponding catch-all branch.
--
--   An empty stack is an exception that can come only from an incomplete
--   function definition.
