{-| This module contains the lex actions that handle the layout rules. The way
    it works is that the 'Parser' monad keeps track of a stack of
    'LayoutContext's specifying the indentation of the layout blocks in scope.
    For instance, consider the following incomplete (Haskell) program:

    > f x = x'
    >   where
    >     x' = case x of { True -> False; False -> ...

    At the @...@ the layout context would be

    > [NoLayout, Layout 4, Layout 0]

    The closest layout block is the one containing the @case@ branches.  This
    block starts with an open brace (@\'{\'@) and so doesn't use layout.  The
    second closest block is the @where@ clause.  Here, there is no open brace
    so the block is started by the @x'@ token which has indentation 4. Finally
    there is a top-level layout block with indentation 0.

{-| Executed upon lexing a close brace (@\'}\'@). Exits the current layout
    context. This might look a bit funny--the lexer will happily use a close
    brace to close a context open by a virtual brace. This is not a problem
    since the parser will make sure the braces are appropriately matched.

{-| Executed for the first token in each line (see 'Agda.Syntax.Parser.Lexer.bol').
    Checks the position of the token relative to the current layout context.
    If the token is

    - /to the left/ :
        Exit the current context and a return virtual close brace (stay in the
        'Agda.Syntax.Parser.Lexer.bol' state).

    - /same column/ :
        Exit the 'Agda.Syntax.Parser.Lexer.bol' state and return a virtual semi
        colon.

    - /to the right/ :
        Exit the 'Agda.Syntax.Parser.Lexer.bol' state and continue lexing.

    If the current block doesn't use layout (i.e. it was started by
    'openBrace') all positions are considered to be /to the right/.

{-| This action is only executed from the 'Agda.Syntax.Parser.Lexer.empty_layout'
    state. It will exit this state, enter the 'Agda.Syntax.Parser.Lexer.bol' state,
    and return a virtual close brace (closing the empty layout block started
    by 'newLayoutContext').

emptyLayout :: LexAction Token
emptyLayout inp _ _ =

{-| Start a new layout context. This is one of two ways to get out of the
    'Agda.Syntax.Parser.Lexer.layout' state (the other is 'openBrace'). There are
    two possibilities:

    - The current token is to the right of the current layout context (or we're
      in a no layout context).

    - The current token is to the left of or in the same column as the current
      context.

    In the first case everything is fine and we enter a new layout context at
    the column of the current token. In the second case we have an empty layout
    block so we enter the 'Agda.Syntax.Parser.Lexer.empty_layout' state. In both
    cases we return a virtual open brace without consuming any input.

    Entering a new state when we know we want to generate a virtual @{}@ may
    seem a bit roundabout. The thing is that we can only generate one token at
    a time, so the way to generate two tokens is to generate the first one and
    then enter a state in which the only thing you can do is generate the
    second one.
