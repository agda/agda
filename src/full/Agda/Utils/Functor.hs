-- | A decoration is a functor that is traversable into any functor.
--
--   The 'Functor' superclass is given because of the limitations
--   of the Haskell class system.
--   @traverseF@ actually implies functoriality.
--
--   Minimal complete definition: @traverseF@ or @distributeF@.

  -- | Decorations commute into any functor.
  distributeF :: (Functor m) => t (m a) -> m (t a)

-- | Any decoration is traversable with @traverse = traverseF@.
--   Just like any 'Traversable' is a functor, so is
--   any decoration, given by just @traverseF@, a functor.

-- | Any decoration is a lens.  @set@ is a special case of @dmap@.

-- | The identity functor is a decoration.

-- Not a decoration are:
--
-- * The constant functor.
-- * Maybe.  Can only be traversed into pointed functors.
-- * Other disjoint sum types, like lists etc.
--   (Can only be traversed into Applicative.)

-- | A typical decoration is pairing with some stuff.
