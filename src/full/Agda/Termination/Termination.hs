-- | TODO: This comment seems to be partly out of date.
--
-- @'terminates' cs@ checks if the functions represented by @cs@
-- terminate. The call graph @cs@ should have one entry ('Call') per
-- recursive function application.
--
-- @'Right' perms@ is returned if the functions are size-change terminating.
--
-- If termination can not be established, then @'Left' problems@ is
-- returned instead. Here @problems@ contains an
-- indication of why termination cannot be established. See 'lexOrder'
-- for further details.
--
-- Note that this function assumes that all data types are strictly
-- positive.
--
-- The termination criterion is taken from Jones et al.
-- In the completed call graph, each idempotent call-matrix
-- from a function to itself must have a decreasing argument.
-- Idempotency is wrt. matrix multiplication.
--
-- This criterion is strictly more liberal than searching for a
-- lexicographic order (and easier to implement, but harder to justify).
