-- Structural orderings

-- | In the paper referred to above, there is an order R with
-- @'Unknown' '<=' 'Le' '<=' 'Lt'@.
--
-- This is generalized to @'Unknown' '<=' 'Decr k'@ where
-- @Decr 1@ replaces @Lt@ and @Decr 0@ replaces @Le@.
-- A negative decrease means an increase.  The generalization
-- allows the termination checker to record an increase by 1 which
-- can be compensated by a following decrease by 2 which results in
-- an overall decrease.
--
-- However, the termination checker of the paper itself terminates because
-- there are only finitely many different call-matrices.  To maintain
-- termination of the terminator we set a @cutoff@ point which determines
-- how high the termination checker can count.  This value should be
-- set by a global or file-wise option.
--
-- See 'Call' for more information.
--
-- TODO: document orders which are call-matrices themselves.

{- instances cannot have implicit arguments?! GHC manual says:

7.8.3.1. Implicit-parameter type constraints

You can't have an implicit parameter in the context of a class or instance declaration. For example, both these declarations are illegal:

  class (?x::Int) => C a where ...
  instance (?x::a) => Foo [a] where ...

Reason: exactly which implicit parameter you pick up depends on
exactly where you invoke a function. But the ``invocation'' of
instance declarations is done behind the scenes by the compiler, so
it's hard to figure out exactly where it is done. Easiest thing is to
outlaw the offending types.

  arbitrary = frequency
    [(20, return Unknown)
    ,(80, elements [- ?cutoff .. ?cutoff + 1] >>= Decr)

{- collapse m

We assume that m codes a permutation:  each row has at most one column
that is not Un.

To collapse a matrix into a single value, we take the best value of
each column and multiply them.  That means if one column is all Un,
i.e., no argument relates to that parameter, than the collapsed value
is also Un.

This makes order multiplication associative.
