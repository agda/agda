{- | This module contains the machinery for inference of size preservation.

     By default, all signatures for functions use distinct size variables.
     Sometimes the variables are not really distinct, and some dependencies between them can be established.
     As an example, consider a function 'length : List A -> Nat'.
     Given a list built from 'n' constructors 'cons', it returns a natural number build from 'n' constructors 'suc'.
     In some sense, 'length' preserves the size of input list in its output natural number.

     Size preservation is a generalization of this idea.
     Initially, it is based on a hypothesis that some codomain size variables are the same as certain domain size variables,
     so the algorithm in this file tries to prove or disprove these hypotheses.
     The actual implementation is rather simple: the algorithm just tries to apply each hypothesis and then check if the constraint graph still behaves well,
     i.e. if there are no cycles with infinities for rigid variables.

     The variables that could be dependent on some other ones are called _possibly size-preserving_ here,
     and the variables that can be the source of dependency are called _candidates_.
     Each possibly size-preserving variable has its own set of candidates.

     It is also worth noting that the coinductive size preservation works dually to the inductive one.
     In the inductive case, we are trying to find out if some codomain sizes are the same as the domain ones,
     and the invariant here is that all domain sizes are independent.
     In the coinductive case, we have a codomain size, and we are trying to check whether some of the domain sizes are equal to this codomain.
     Assume a function 'zipWith : (A -> B -> C) -> Stream A -> Stream B -> Stream C'.
     This function is size-preserving in both its coinductive arguments, since it applies the same amount of projections to arguments as it was asked for the result.
