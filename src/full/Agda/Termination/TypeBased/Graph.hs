{- | Contains the algorithm for processing graph dependencies.

     The central structure of the algorithm is a bounded meet-semilattice of rigid size variables, where the upper bound is an infinite ordinal.
     In this file, the elements of the semilattice are referred to as size expressions.

     Given the semilattice, the algorithm tries to find an assignment of size expressions to all flexible variables.
     The main requirement is that the assignment should satisfy the _constraint graph_.
     The semantical meaning of the constraint graph is that it completely describes the dependencies between flexible variables in
     some internal term.

     There is a trivial solution which assigns the inifnity to all flexible variables.
     However, it is preferable to find a more precise assignment. In ideal case, we need to find a "universal" one,
     i.e. an assignment, such that for any other assignment all variables are assigned to a bigger or equal size expression.
     The semantical meaning here is that we are trying to find a witness of termination of a function,
     and the universal solution allows to get the most optimistic description of size dependencies for recursive calls.

     The algorithm here relies on the notion of clusters, which is explained in 'Agda.Termination.TypeBased.Patterns'
