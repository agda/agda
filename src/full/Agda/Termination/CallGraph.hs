-- Calls

-- | Call graph nodes.
--
--   Machine integer 'Int' is sufficient, since we cannot index more than
--   we have addresses on our machine.

type Node = Int

-- | Calls are edges in the call graph.
--   It can be labelled with several call matrices if there
--   are several pathes from one function to another.

type Call cinfo = Edge Node (CMSet cinfo)

callMatrixSet = label

-- | Make a call with a single matrix.

mkCall s t m cinfo = Edge s t $ singleton $ CallMatrixAug m cinfo

-- | Make a call with empty @cinfo@.

-- Call graphs

-- | A call graph is a set of calls. Every call also has some
-- associated meta information, which should be 'Monoid'al so that the
-- meta information for different calls can be combined when the calls
-- are combined.

newtype CallGraph cinfo = CallGraph { theCallGraph :: Graph Node (CMSet cinfo) }
  deriving (Show)


-- | Returns all the nodes with incoming edges.  Somewhat expensive. @O(e)@.

targetNodes :: CallGraph cinfo -> Set Node
targetNodes = Graph.targetNodes . theCallGraph

-- | Converts a call graph to a list of calls with associated meta
--   information.

toList :: CallGraph cinfo -> [Call cinfo]
toList = Graph.edges . theCallGraph

-- | Converts a list of calls with associated meta information to a
--   call graph.

fromList :: [Call cinfo] -> CallGraph cinfo
fromList = CallGraph . Graph.fromEdgesWith CMSet.union

-- | 'null' checks whether the call graph is completely disconnected.
instance Null (CallGraph cinfo) where
  empty = CallGraph Graph.empty
  null  = List.all (null . label) . toList

-- | Takes the union of two call graphs.

union :: CallGraph cinfo -> CallGraph cinfo -> CallGraph cinfo
union (CallGraph cs1) (CallGraph cs2) = CallGraph $
  Graph.unionWith CMSet.union cs1 cs2

-- | 'CallGraph' is a monoid under 'union'.

instance Semigroup (CallGraph cinfo) where
  (<>) = union

instance Monoid (CallGraph cinfo) where
  mempty  = empty
  mappend = (<>)

-- | Inserts a call into a call graph.

-- GHC supports implicit-parameter constraints in instance declarations
-- only from 7.4.  To maintain compatibility with 7.2, we skip this instance:
-- KEEP:

--   combineNewOld (CallGraph new) (CallGraph old) = CallGraph -*- CallGraph $ combineNewOld comb old
--     -- combined calls:
--     where comb = Graph.composeWith (>*<) CMSet.union new old

-- Non-overloaded version:
combineNewOldCallGraph :: (Monoid cinfo, ?cutoff :: CutOff) => CombineNewOldT (CallGraph cinfo)
combineNewOldCallGraph (CallGraph new) (CallGraph old) = CallGraph -*- CallGraph $ combineNewOld comb old
    -- combined calls:
    where comb = Graph.composeWith (>*<) CMSet.union new old

-- | Call graph comparison.
--   A graph @cs'@ is ``worse'' than @cs@ if it has a new edge (call)
--   or a call got worse, which means that one of its elements
--   that was better or equal to 'Le' moved a step towards 'Un'.
--
--   A call graph is complete if combining it with itself does not make it
--   any worse.  This is sound because of monotonicity:  By combining a graph
--   with itself, it can only get worse, but if it does not get worse after
--   one such step, it gets never any worse.

-- | @'complete' cs@ completes the call graph @cs@. A call graph is
-- complete if it contains all indirect calls; if @f -> g@ and @g ->
-- h@ are present in the graph, then @f -> h@ should also be present.
