--   everything it imports.

module Agda.Termination.CutOff where

-- | Cut off structural order comparison at some depth in termination checker?

data CutOff
  = CutOff Int -- ^ @c >= 0@ means: record decrease up to including @c+1@.
  | DontCutOff

instance Show CutOff where
  show (CutOff k) = show k
  show DontCutOff = "âˆž"

-- That's it!
