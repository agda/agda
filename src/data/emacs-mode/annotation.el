  "Annotate text between START and END in the current buffer.

Nothing happens if either START or END are out of bounds for the
current (possibly narrowed) buffer, or END <= START.

If ANNS is nil, then those text properties between START and END
that have been set by this function are deleted. Otherwise the
following happens.

All the symbols in ANNS are looked up in `annotation-bindings',
and the resulting list of faces is used to set the face text
property. For each position in the range the faces are merged
with the current value of the annotation-faces text property, and
both the face and the annotation-faces text properties are set to
the resulting list of faces.

If TOKEN-BASED is non-nil, then the annotation-token-based
property is set to t. This means that all text properties set by
`annotation-annotate' in this range are interpreted as being
token-based, including those set by previous calls to this
procedure.

If the string INFO is non-nil, the mouse-face
property is set to highlight, and INFO is used as the help-echo
string. If GOTO has the form (FILENAME . POSITION), then the
mouse-face property is set to highlight, and the given
filename/position will be used by `annotation-goto-indirect' when
it is invoked with a position in the given range.

Note that if a given attribute is defined by several faces, then
the first face's setting takes precedence.

All characters whose text properties get set also have the
annotation-annotated property set to t, and
annotation-annotations is set to a list with all the properties
that have been set; this ensures that the text properties can
later be removed (if the annotation-* properties are not tampered
with)."

`annotation-annotate'). If info and/or goto are present they will
be used as the corresponding arguments to `annotation-annotate'.

If INFO is nil in a call to `annotation-annotate', and the GOTO
argument is a cons-cell, then the INFO argument is set to
GOTO-HELP. The intention is that the default help text should
inform the user about the \"goto\" facility.

If REMOVE is nil, then old syntax highlighting information is not
removed. Otherwise all token-based syntax highlighting is
removed. In order to reduce the risk of flicker this highlighting
is removed step by step, in conjunction with the addition of new
highlighting. (This process assumes that CMDS is ordered by the
positions of the annotations. If it isn't, then the highlighting
is still applied correctly, but perhaps with more flicker.)
